      From: Commander Triangle Sector

      <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urgently and respectfully request a modification of the orders for the assault ship Asia.  Admiral Kinnison requests that the Asia with her embarked personnel be sent to Baker's World to deliver 644 crewmen for the ships in TF24 that are currently in need of replacements.  In addition to the crewmen, the Asia will also need to carry 25 Marines for assignment to the Tuscaloosa (NCC-5042).  Admiral Kinnison believes it is of greater urgency to the Federation efforts in the Triangle to have TF24 brought up to full complement as quickly as possible.  As soon as repairs are completed and crew reassigned, TF24 will rejoin the fight to push the upstart Klingons out of The Triangle and back to their own space.

      <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orders for Asia are rescinded and it is returned to Triangle Sector control.  As replacement personnel were already available at Star Base 10, and the fleet has been in need of replacements for over a week, Star Fleet Headquarters must wonder why the personnel were not sent out on Asia earlier.
      <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are any excess personnel from Outpost 1 left after assignments to Task Force 24 are complete, the Asia is to detach from Triangle Sector control and execute its previous orders.

      Task Force 89 arrives at the <B>Altharra</B> system.  As they enter the outer edges of the system the battle cruisers <I>Resolution</I> and <I>Defence</I> turn quickly and race toward the shadowing vessels.  The shadows turn and race away at warp 8.  Although faster, the battle cruisers, being at warp speed, are unable to engage.  They do close sufficiently to identify the vessels as three D-7 cruisers.  After a short period paralleling the Klingons' course, the pursuers turn back and rejoin the fleet.

      The <B>Landis Wavamm</B> system comes on the communications waves reporting that it has thrown off the Klingon garrison.  When the garrison's squadron of star ships left the system, the inhabitants were able to defeat the Klingon forces.  They urgently request supplies of small arms and warships to allow themselves to keep their independence.

      Star Fleet headquarters has forwarded the important parts of a message received by the Federation foreign relations council from the government of the Mantiev Colonial Associaton.  The recent attack on the <B>Mantiev</B> system has left them virtually defenseless.  The largest surviving ship in their fleet is a Class VI repair tender, and the largest warship is a Class IV escort.  They are pleading to have some warships sent to them.  Star Fleet headquarters indicates that it has ordered two Fenlon class monitors be towed to <B>Mantiev</B> along with two Epsilon class cutters and an old Larson class destroyer taken from the reserve fleet.  However, due to the long transit time for some of these vessels, Commander Triangle Sector is requested to provide whatever assistance he can to the MCA.  In fulfilling this request Commander Triangle Sector is reminded that only ships with older technology should be transferred to the MCA.
