      From 2/2505.04 to 2/2505.10 four Star Fleet ships enter AOFW space from the "north" and "northwest".  The AOFW received no warning about their coming, nor was permission requested for them to enter.  Some senior members of the AOFW Space Navy and the civilian government are beginning to feel that Star Fleet is taking them for granted.  They are not happy at the situation.
