      The communications channels are crowded with messages from <B>Mantiev</B>.  On 2/2505.01 two Klingon battle groups entered the <B>Mantiev</B> system.  They attacked and destroyed the Mantiev's Mobile Defense Force and the garrison in the <B>Mantiev</B> system.  After the battle, the Klingons boarded the repair outpost in orbit around the planet.  They took the outpost in tow and left the system.

When the garrison's squadron of star ships left the system, the inhabitants were able to defeat the Klingon forces.

      Fleet headquarters has forwarded the important parts of a message received by the foreign relations directorate from the government of the Mantiev Colonial Associaton.  The recent attack on the <B>Mantiev</B> system has left them virtually defenseless.  The largest surviving ship in their fleet is a Class VI repair tender, and the largest warship is a Class IV escort.  They are pleading to have some warships sent to them.  Fleet headquarters indicates that it has ordered a V-11 Stormbird cruiser, two T-5 Fire Swarm destroyers, and two S-3 Free Flight scouts be transferred to <B>Mantiev</B> control.  However, due to the long transit time for some of these vessels, Commander Triangle Sector is requested to provide whatever assistance he can to the MCA.  In fulfilling this request Commander Triangle Sector is reminded that the only ships with older technology should be transferred to the MCA.
