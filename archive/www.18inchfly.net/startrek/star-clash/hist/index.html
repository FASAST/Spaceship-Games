The week saw the beginning of the end of the war.  The four significant events were the IKS raid on <B>Landis Wavamm</B>, the liberation of <B>Farkin</B>, the destruction of <B>New New Aberdeen</B>, and the destruction of <B>Federation Starbase 10</B>.

<UL>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
On 2/2505.11 (day 41) at <B>New Paradise</B>, some of the larger Federation units suddenly charged out toward the IKS shadows.  The IKS cruisers withdrew quickly.  Rather than return to the system, they headed "south" towards <B>Landis Wavamm</B> to take advantage of the confusion due to the system's recent rebellion against the Klingon Empire.
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Arriving at the system they detected a force of three medium sized Klingon ships.  Each force headed towards the other to do battle.  However, neither side really wanted a fight.  The IKS ships wanted to avoid damage so they could eventually go back to shadowing duty.  The Klingon ships expected that they were probably outclassed, and didn't think they could win the battle (they were probably right).  The IKS squadron commander indicated that they would forego a fight if they were allowed to take what they wanted from the planet.  The Klingon squadron commander decided to allow this.  The rebellious authorities on <B>Landis Wavamm</B> were told that the IKS ships would not be stopped as a punishment for the rebellion.
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
For three days the IKS marines had their run of the planet.  Then, sensors detected a force of four Klingon ships approaching the system.  With their holds full of valuable minerals, advanced electronic equipment, money, and feather boas (an affectation of many of the IKS female officers) the IKS squadron withdrew its marines and left for <B>New Paradise</B> well pleased with their haul of booty.
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Signaling to the IKS high command, they requested that a freighter be sent to meet them at <B>New Paradise</B>.  This was done.  On 2/2505.27 a freighter and cruiser were scheduled to meet the raiders, embark the booty, and then head to the OFMA to trade it for Klingon photon torpedo launchers.  The launchers were to be used in the refitting of old D-18 Gulls.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
On 2/2505.15 (day 45), the Star Fleet force at <B>Farkin</B> finally succeeded in liberating the system from its Klingon garrison.  The next day, Rear Admiral Parksley without bothering to inform the temporary government that they were on their own, headed "west" for <B>Flood</B>.  After a two day trip, Task Force 65 arrived at <B>Flood</B>.  On 2/2505.19 the task force began the effort to liberate the <B>Flood</B> system.
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
The day after Parksley left <B>Farkin</B>, Vice Admiral Kinneson's Task Force 24 arrived at the system looking for the part of his fleet with Task Force 65.  Having miscalculated the rendezvous, Kinneson went to <B>Flood</B>, collected his missing units, and then headed "south" to investigate the situation at <B>Landis Wavamm</B>.

From this point on the events are based not on actual battles, but upon the Campaign Master's best estimate of what would have happened due to the orders given by the various force commanders.

<UL>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
After the destruction of <B>Federation Outpost 1</B>, many Klingon commanders believed that the escaping force included part of Federation Task Force 24, last seen at the Battle of <B>Farkin</B>.  Upon reflection, Admirals Ghoval and Ker'chuck concluded that this was not accurate.  But, if Kinneson did not go to <B>Outpost 1</B>, then were did he go?  One possibility was the Affiliation of Outer Free Worlds.  This was confirmed when an exchange of intelligence with the Romulans revealed that the Romulans were aware of a large, unexpected, and unexplained increase in message traffic between the Star Fleet Liaison office to the AOFW Space Navy at <B>Baker's World</B> and Star Fleet's Triangle Sector headquarters.
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
With the general location of Task Force 24's repairs determined, Thought Admiral Massavid asked two of his commanders to undertake an attack to punish the AOFW.  After long discussions, Admirals Krraa'zi and Ker'chuck agreed to go to <B>New New Aberdeen</B> as part of what was known as Operation Brown Stain.  <B>New New Aberdeen</B> was selected in place of <B>Baker's World</B> because it was near the edge of the AOFW, and the attacking fleets could possibly reach it without detection.
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
On 2/2505.11 (day 41), Admiral Ker'chuck left <B>Klingon Starbase 1</B> headed for <B>New New Aberdeen</B> via a route which skirted the AOFW well to the "north".  Three days later after finishing repairs from the <I><B>Massacre at Mantiev</B>,</I> Admiral Krraa'zi followed Ker'chuck.  Krraa'zi also ordered the part of his fleet already headed for <B>Federation Star Base 10</B> to divert to <B>New New Aberdeen</B>.
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Exactly on schedule, on 2/2505.19 (day 49), the three parts of the two battle groups met just outside of the <B>New New Aberdeen</B> system.  Entering the target system, Ker'chuck informed the AOFW defenders that helping the Federation was the cause of the attack.  Despite the presence of the AOFW's Task Fleet 2 led by five Mackenzie class frigates, the AOFW force was no match for the attacking Klingons. <FONT SIZE=-1>[This battle was not played out as it was too large for effective play, and with thirty nine major Klingon combatants against seventeen AOFW major ships, the outcome was obvious.]</FONT>
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Following the battle, the two battle groups headed back to <B>Klingon Starbase 1</B> for repairs, and to defend it from a possible copycat attack by Star Fleet.

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#FF2200"><B>&#149;</B></FONT> <B>Destruction of Federation Star Base 10</B>

<UL>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Star Base 10 was a tempting target for the Klingons from the start of the war.  By 2/2505.20 they had resolved to launch an attack to destroy the star base.  This was named Operation Hammer.
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Expecting heavy resistance, Thought Admiral Massavid called for four battle groups, including the double sized group of Admiral Ghoval.  It took Massavid almost two weeks to convince the other commanders to join in the effort.  In the case of Admiral Krraa'zi, Massavid was forced to agree to help him in his attack on the <B>Mantiev</B> system.  Around 2/2505.01 Massavid finalized his plans.  He called for Ghoval and Vul'ture to join him in the attack.
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
On 2/2505.11, Ghoval left <B>Klingon Outpost 1</B>.  At the same time, Massavid and Vul'ture left the <B>Haven</B> system.  The attack was set to occur on 2/2505.19 (day 49), at the same time as Ker'chuck and Kraa'zi would be attacking <B>New New Aberdeen</B>.
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Although detected by a number of systems along the way, there was no Federation response to the approaching attack.  On the scheduled day the Klingon fleets arrived at the star base.  Unexpectedly, the protecting garrison was  pathetic.  Two Chandley class frigates and three destroyers were the largest combat ships present.  The Klingons concentrated on the garrison, which was quickly eliminated.  With the garrison gone, the outposts were destroyed by long range fire from beyond their weapons' maximum range.
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
When the star base was gone, the fleets reorganized.  Ghoval assigned Battle Force Crusk'kin to Massavid.  Massavid's damaged ships were given to Vul'ture and replaced by undamaged ships from Ghoval and Vul'ture.  As Ghoval and Vul'ture returned to <B>Klingon Outpost 1</B> for repairs, Massavid headed to <B>Federation Outpost 2</B>.

The destruction of <B>Federation Star Base 10</B> was well beyond the last straw for Star Fleet headquarters.  On 2/2505.21 (day 51), Vice Admiral Kinneson, the Triangle Sector commander and commander of Star Fleet Task Force 24 was relieved of his sector command and ordered to bring Task Force 24 back to Federation territory at its maximum speed.
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
At warp 6, Task Force 24 arrived at the <B>Derigo</B> system 2/2506.07 (day 67).  By that time this system had been designated as the temporary headquarters for the Triangle Sector, on.  Kinneson was relieved of the force's command and placed under arrest.  Shamed by his performance, Star Fleet ordered him returned to Terra for a general court martial.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Following the destruction of <B>Federation Star Base 10</B> Thought Admiral Massavid took his enlarged fleet to <B>Federation Outpost 2</B>.  Unbeknownst to him, his mission was to be a race.  Both the IKS and Commander Seidhr of the Romulan Space Navy had planned on launching attacks on <B>Federation Outpost 2</B> if ever <B>Star Base 10</B> was destroyed.  Only their delays in organizing the attacks allowed Massavid to execute his attack first.
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Arriving on 2/2505.26 (day 56) he immediately launched an attack.  The outpost's garrison of a LaSalle class frigate, a Thufir class destroyer, four Griffon class escorts, and two Remora class escorts was easily overwhelmed.  A few minutes after the engagement started the outpost was an expanding cloud of wreckage.  With only minor damage to his ships, Massavid headed for <B>Klingon Outpost 1</B> to repair and prepare for the expected attacks by the Federation fleets in The Triangle.

The Klingon destruction of <B>Federataion Outpost 1</B> broke the morale of Star Fleet.  It finally became clear to headquarters that the commanders in the sector were totally unable to handle the situation.  On 2/2506.07 (day 67), all Star Fleet forces outside of the Federation in The Triangle were ordered to immediately return to Federation territory.  No exceptions and no disagreements were permitted.
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
On 2/2506.16 (day 76) Task Force 65 reached Derigo.  On 2/2506.22 (day 82) Task Force 89 also arrived.  As each force entered the system, the commander was relieved, a new commander appointed, and the force sent out to try to defend the Federation's borders from the expected attacks by the Klingons.

Klingon diplomacy (no, it is not a complete oxymoron) took over.  On 2/2506.01 a diplomatic mission from the Klingon Empire received permission to discuss ending hostilities with the AOFW.  Seeing their allies, the Federation, retreat from The Triangle in defeat, the government of the AOFW was receptive to the Klingon overtures.
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
The Klingon proposal was simple.  The AOFW was to withdraw from the war.  Renounce its treaty with the Federation, and prohibit Star Fleet ships from entering the AOFW or using its repair facilities.  In return, the Klingons would agree to leave the AOFW alone, and provide it with a modest repair outpost to replace the Invictus outpost destroyed (the repair outpost was later confirmed as a Romulan Nestar).
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
The AOFW responded positively, and quickly put forward a counter proposal.  The Klingons would also provide the AOFW with a Z-4 Deathgame outpost and three modern cruisers.  These would replace some of the AOFW's losses.  Seeing a quick end to the issue, the Klingons agreed.  On 2/2506.24 (day 84), the agreement was signed by both parties.

Star Fleet had been beaten in the field, and the senior commanders knew it.  The only military option was to bring in more and larger fleets.  This would undoubtedly lead to a general war.  The choice was simple; either expand the war or end it.  The Federation chose to try to end it.
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Federation peace overtures to the Klingon Empire were quickly returned.  Federation intelligence had made the options known to the Klingons; make peace or face general war.  A peace commission met at the Precipice system beginning on 2/2506.25 (day 85).  While a final agreement was weeks away, everyone knew the basics of what would be allowed.  The Klingons claimed and were grudgingly given sovereignty over the five conquered systems in The Triangle.  Star Fleet was to be allowed to place no more than two outposts along the Federation's border with The Triangle for the next ten years.  Finally, no more than ten Star Fleet ships would be allowed to be in The Triangle at any one time for the next five years.  Although Klingon radicals wanted more, and Federation militarists wanted to fight, both sides accepted the agreement.

Admiral Ker'chuck, the hero of <B>Farkin</B>, after waking from a drunken stupor to receive his awards and honors, was promoted to command of The Triangle Sector.  The repercussions of this will be felt for years, as will the impact on blood wine consumption within this part of the Klingon Empire.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ker'chuck's five years as Triangle Sector commander were marked by a notable drop in the amount of taxes reported back to the empirial treasury.  At the same time, massive investments in blood wine production turned a number of systems into the primary suppliers of cheap wine for the Klingon Empire.  The "Chuckie" Development Corporation also funneled incredible amounts of money into the development of an uninhabited system near Starbase 1 known as "Ve'gas", turning it into a center for gambling and "pleasures".  The result was a major upswing in the economic situation for the Klingons in the area.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inexplicably, the reassignment of Admiral Ker'chuck back to combat duty resulted in the collapse of the blood wine industry, as demand plummeted overnight.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen the wreckage that was once Star Base 10.  I could not believe that I had so underestimated both the Klingons and my own command.  I know the war is effectively over now.  The best that could be hoped for is a draw without resorting to a general war.  Admiral Kinnison insisted that the way to win was a full scale assault into Klingon territory, but any sane man knew that was folly.  With the loss of our outposts there was nothing we could do that the Klingons could not quickly undo.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Court martials will probably follow for all the admirals in this sector, but that was the logical outcome for such gross failure.  Perhaps retirement and following the Path to Kolinar would work at this stage in life.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the total defeat in The Triangle War, Star Fleet's shame was too great.  The name of Admiral Kinneson was never, never spoken by anyone within Star Fleet.  The few who even mentioned it found themselves to be outcasts.  One story is that a cadet at the academy trying to research the former admiral's history was dismissed.  Many feel that the only way for Star Fleet to recover, will be to win another war in The Triangle.
