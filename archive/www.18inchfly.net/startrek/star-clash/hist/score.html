<B><FONT SIZE=+2>Side Analysis</FONT></B>

</CENTER>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
The sides are listed in the relative order of how well they did during the war.
</P>

<P>
<B>Klingon Empire</B>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
The Klingon Empire clearly won this war, and deserved to win the war.  Their admirals conceived a grand strategy; they planned a way to implement the strategy; and they executed that strategy.
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
The strategy was relatively straightforward.  To defeat the Federation and win the war, they had to conquer enough worlds to make the war worthwhile.  To conquer worlds, they had to eliminate the enemy's ability to re-conquer systems.  To stop the re-conquest of systems they had to destroy the enemy's fleets' ability to fight, or to reduce their enemy's willingness to engage in combat.  To do this, they decided to destroy the Federation's ability to repair their ships after combat.  With that done, Star Fleet would be less likely to interfere with their plans, or would take significant time to repair after any fight.
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Clearly, the strategy, and its implementation, worked.  The Klingon commanders negotiated with each other to gain cooperation, and then carried through with their plans.
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Although well executed, the Klingon war effort did have some problems.  The Klingons started the war poorly.  Except for Ker'chuck, they wasted almost two full weeks sitting at their bases and training.  It was unproductive and un-Klingon.  But that was ended by the <I><B>Battle of Farkin</B>,</I> which seemed to energize the lagging Klingon courage.  The necessity of the <I><B>Massacre at Mantiev</B></I> must also be questioned.  While demanded by Admiral Krraa'zi as a concession for his participation in either Operation Hammer or Operation Brown Stain, the attack did nothing to further the Klingon cause.  Rather, it brought the Mantiev Colonial Association into the war, and delayed the truly significant operations by almost a week.
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Besides the military operations, the Klingons showed an awareness that diplomacy is also needed to win a war.  After the attack on <B>New New Aberdeen</B>, the Klingons began diplomatic moves to quickly remove the Affiliation of Outer Free Worlds from the war.  Having (accurately) accused the AOFW of aiding Star Fleet, the Klingons offered the AOFW a way to avoid a war with the much larger and more powerful Klingon Empire.  Surprisingly, the Klingons were quite reasonable in their negotiations with the AOFW, and succeeded in removing the AOFW from their list of active enemies.
</P>

<P>
<B>Imperial Klingon States</B>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
The Imperial Klingon States were the only nation which actually did the things the Campaign Master thought were good ideas for any nation in the war; and it did these thing almost flawlessly.
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Relatively early in the campaign, the IKS reorganized its forces.  A single large battle fleet was organized, and positioned to be able to respond to any intrusion.  Scout forces were thrown out around the IKS to detect such intrusions.  Raider forces were created and deployed to follow potentially dangerous fleets.  The result was a nation ready to defend itself, and able to gather the intelligence to warn it when it might come under attack.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Finally, in true Klingon and pirate style, the IKS took advantage of its one clear opportunity when the <B>Landis Wavamm</B> system rebelled.  Grabbing its chance, an IKS force used diplomacy and military threats to gain access to the planet and plunder it.  And this worked against other Klingons!
</P>

<P>
<B>Romulan Empire</B>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Unlike the Klingons, the Romulans did almost nothing during the war.  This, it turned out was an excellent move (or non-move) on their part.
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
From the beginning the Romulan commanders decided to wait and see who would come out behind between the Federation and the Klingons.  Whichever did would be a good target for the Romulan Space Navy.  So, the Romulans sat at their star bases, trained, and waited for their opportunity.
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Due to the speed of the Klingon offensive, and the total lack of Federation response, the Romulans never had a chance to take real action.  Following the destruction of <B>Federation Star Base 10</B>, Commander Saeihr did embark on a raid to destroy <B>Federation Outpost 1</B>, but the Klingons beat her to the target.
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Despite their lack of action, the Romulans are sure that they have come out well as a result of the war.  The Triangle has returned to "peace".  The Romulans know that they will return to their clandestine efforts to covert systems along their borders.  Their efforts worked well in the past, and without the Federation's influence, they will work even better in the future.
</P>

<P>
<B>United Federation of Planets</B>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
It is almost painful to describe the UFP's activities during the war.  Star Fleet did nothing ... no ... absolutely nothing right.
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
At no time did the Star Fleet forces demonstrate or even suggest that there was any thought out, cohesive, or practical plan of operation.  At no time did Star Fleet execute any operations which indicated that they had an idea of what it would take to win the war.  At no time did Star Fleet show an awareness that diplomacy or tact was necessary when dealing with allies or independent systems.
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
The initial Federation moves were to shotgun themselves out into The Triangle.  Vice Admiral Kinneson took his fleet and that of Rear Admiral Parksley to the <B>Farkin</B> and <B>Flood</B> systems.  Neither system had any strategic importance, and would have been easy for the Klingons to re-conquer.  More importantly, Kinneson split his fleet, and did not assign any assault ships to the operations until days after the fleets arrived at their destinations.  The result was that the two task forces signaled their intentions to the Klingons, and had to sit and wait for additional forces to arrive.  Kinneson paid for this gross error at the <I><B>Battle of Farkin</B>,</I> when the lead part of his fleet was attacked by a Klingon battle group.  In that battle, the Federation force was so poorly led, that what should have been a hard fought battle became a rout, with the Federation force fleeing the field to avoid total destruction.
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Kinneson retreated into the AOFW under the provisions of a secret treaty to allow Star Fleet to repair therein.  However, he ignored warnings to limit communications and these were detected by the Romulans who eventually passed the information on to the Klingons.  Further, Kinneson alienated the AOFW by repeatedly ignoring their sovereignty and failing to inform them of transiting Star Fleet ships.
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Meanwhile, Parksley, with the most powerful force in the sector (his own fleet, reinforcements, and almost half of Kinneson's fleet) sat at <B>Flood</B>.  He then mindlessly followed Kinneson's orders to the letter to go to <B>Farkin</B> and attack the Klingons, although he had seen the Klingon fleet from <B>Farkin</B> pass by <B>Flood</B> on its way back to perform repairs.  The result was simply more delays before he was able to start trying to liberate either of the systems.  Troops were not landed on <B>Farkin</B> until the twenty-fifth day of the war, although the first fleet arrived in the area on the tenth day.
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Kinneson compounded the  Federation's potential for disaster by repeatedly stripping the garrisons of the sector's outposts of most of their major combatant units and failing to reinforce any of the garrisons with the reinforcements sent to the sector.  Although already well aware that each of his sector's fleets was far superior as a fighting unit to any single Klingon battle group and maybe even two battle groups, Kinneson added garrison and reinforcement ships to the fleets rather than defend his bases.  When the destruction of <B>Federation Outpost 1</B> showed the Klingons' interest in Federation outposts and the weakness of the defenses at those outposts, Kinneson completely disregarded the situation.  As the Klingons moved against <B>Federation Star Base 10</B>, communications indicated that Kinneson was certain that <B>Federation Outpost 2</B> was the next target.  Not only did he send no forces to help the outpost, he moved his own fleet farther from the one location in the sector where he knew it was most needed.
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
On top of the other issues for Vice Admiral Kinneson, he received two explicit orders from Star Fleet headquarters to provide them with information about his plans for the prosecution of the war.  Whether he ignored these orders out of disinterest, ignorance, or simply because he didn't have any plans for the prosecution of the war is unclear.  Regardless, ignoring direct orders from the high command is a rather ... bad ... idea for a military officer.
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
During all of this, Rear Admiral T'nek went off on a tour of the northeastern, eastern, and southern parts of The Triangle, which did little but push the IKS into properly preparing itself to resist an attack, and worry the Romulans.  T'nek repeatedly warned Kinneson of the threats to the Federation outposts.  Despite this, he ignored his own warnings and moved farther and farther away from Federation territory.  Rather than attempting to rectify the situation, he attacked <B>New Paradise</B>, another strategically meaningless system.  On top of all else, T'nek also was able to anger the government of the <B>Altherra</B> system by sitting at their system instead of moving of to do something useful.
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
The United Federation of Planets clearly lost this war, and deserved to lose the war.  Their admirals failed to create a strategy; they failed to make any logical moves; and they succeeded in alienating even their friends.
