<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
The campaign has been ended by declaration of the Campaign Master on Stardate 2/2505.19 (Day 49).
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
On this date, a two battle group Klingon force arrived at New New Aberdeen in the AOFW, and a four battle group Klingon force arrived at Federation Star Base 10.  Although New New Aberdeen was defended by a garrison and a task fleet, the force was no possible match for the Klingons.  At Federation Star Base 10 the garrison was pathetic, having been stripped of all major warships by the sector commander.  The only question was how few Klingon ships would be damaged.
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
A discussion with the Federation sector commander indicated that he had no plans to defend his remaining repair facility (Federation Outpost 2), which he knew would be attacked, and which the Klingons, IKS, and Romulans had all planned to destroy.  Further, his plans were totally unrealistic as to how to prosecute the war from this point.  Assuming that the loss of all Federation fixed facilities would have resulted in the recall and court martial of the sector commander plus the relief of the fleet commanders, there seemed no point in continuing with the disaster which the campaign had become.
</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
As things were, the only question was how long it would be before the Klingons mopped up the Federation forces.
