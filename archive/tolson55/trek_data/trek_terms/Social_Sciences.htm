  interpersonal relationships between individuals in those societies. Every Star 
  Fleet officer has training in these areas with respect to his own race, planet,

  all have skill in at least one other area, and many have training in more than 
  one area.</font></P>

  ancient cultures, their history, and their lifestyles. It includes the study
