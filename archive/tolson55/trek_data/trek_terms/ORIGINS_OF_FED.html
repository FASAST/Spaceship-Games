<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFCC00">The United Federation of Planets is the 
  largest economic, political, and social organization in recorded history. Sphere-shaped 
  and with a diameter of over 180 parsecs, it spans more than half the known spiral 
  of the Milky Way galaxy. The Federation currently maintains over 500 member 
  worlds, supported by a fully developed bureaucratic infrastructure and defended 
  by the most powerful collection of starships ever to span the stars.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFCC00">More importantly, the United Federation 
  of Planets represents the galaxy’s most successful attempt to protect the individual 
  freedoms and rights of sentient beings, regardless of their biological origin 
  or social affiliation. In a universe where cultures often dedicate themselves 
  to domination and ruthless expansionism, the Federation advances the knowledge 
  and economic and social progress of every member world. In addition, it upholds 
  the right of <I>individual </I>worlds to govern themselves as each sees fit.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFCC00">The United Federation of Planets is the 
  product of the combined efforts of hundreds of statesmen and politicians, soldiers 
  and diplomats, and Humans and Humanoids originating from five highly distinct 
  civilizations. They all shared a common dream: given the opportunity, sentient 
  creatures among the stars can exist and prosper in mutual harmony and peace. 
  Having overcome the threat of cultural extinction (often by only a narrow margin 
  of safety), these five cultures shared the profound desire to seek out others 
  like themselves with whom to share the universe.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFCC00">Following a series of almost disastrous 
  global wars in their 20th century, Terrans began to migrate to the neighboring 
  worlds of their own system and then to the nearest star system. The labors of 
  these early explorers were rewarded in the year 2042, with the discovery of 
  the culturally and scientifically advanced civilization of Alpha Centauri. Cultural 
  exchanges resulted in peace accords, which were largely possible due to the 
  surprisingly similar physical characteristics of the two races.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFCC00">Combining the Alpha Centauran Zephram 
  Cochrane’s principles of spacial warp displacement with Human engineering ingenuity 
  resulted in many early colonization efforts, bringing the two races even closer 
  together. A chance encounter with Vulcans in the year 2065 might easily have 
  ended in unnecessary hostility were it not for the quick thinking and restraint 
  shown by both sides. Their reactions are surprising, considering the Vulcans 
  were not only distinctly alien in their physical appearance, but also alien 
  in their emotional (or non-emotional) makeup as well.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFCC00">Not all unexpected contacts ended so 
  pleasantly. Between 2070 and 2085, these three starfaring races were forced 
  to deal with the last vestiges of the Vegan Tyranny. The presence of a common 
  foe united the three powers and planted the seeds of the Federation. Despite 
  the threat of this mysterious enemy, the twelve-year period between 2075 and 
  2087 has often been called Terra’s Golden Age. During this period, contact with 
  the Tellarites ended in peaceful cooperation and mutual benefit. Also, the first 
  wave of Human and Human-Centauran colonial efforts began to bear fruit. It was 
  a time when the vast richness of the Orion Homeworlds was discovered and when 
  the existence of Romulan and Klingon savagery was yet unimagined.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFCC00">Toward the end of the century, these 
  races made contact with the Andorian civilization, which would later become 
  a founding member of the Federation. In this instance, the allied races’ overt 
  bluffing and aggressive postering helped defuse a potentially hostile situation. 
  The Andorians were a much older race, and their space exploration pre-dated 
  both Alpha Centauran and Human efforts. They had more than sufficient reason 
  to be wary of alien contact, given their previous encounters with the remnants 
  of the Vegan Tyranny. Nevertheless, the advantages of mutual alliance outweighed 
  the dubious gains of hard-to-hold conquests, and the Andorians joined the informal 
  alliance.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFCC00">Many Terran textbooks credit Humans as 
  being the driving force behind creation of the Federation. This is about as 
  true as saying that the attempts to form such an interstellar body met with 
  positive responses and unparalleled success. Actually, it was the Alpha Centauri 
  statesman Zorafran Stallamaine who first suggested forming a political union 
  of the Five Primary Worlds, as Alpha Centauri, Andor, Tellar, Terra, and Vulcan 
  were then known. Similarly, the first serious discussion of political union, 
  which took place on Alpha Centauri in 2077, ended in disaffection and discord, 
  due primarily to the inability to define the specific goals and objectives of 
  the new, experimental governmental order.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFCC00">It was the Vulcans who, during the period 
  from 2077 to 2082, worked with fellow delegates to keep the hope of a Federation 
  alive. Their contributions, more than any other, culminated in a second conference 
  on Vulcan in 2082. At this meeting, many of the objections and disagreements 
  that had surfaced on Alpha Centauri five years earlier were overcome by compromise 
  and by applying the principles from the famous Statutes of Alpha Ill. Nevertheless, 
  so great were the cultural differences between the Five Primary Worlds that 
  an additional five years of effort remained before delegates assembled on the 
  neutral planetoid of Babel. In 2087, they adopted the Articles of Federation 
  and established a lasting governmental body to maintain peace throughout the 
  galaxy.</font></P>
