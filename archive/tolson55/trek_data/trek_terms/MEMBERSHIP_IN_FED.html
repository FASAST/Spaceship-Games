<B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4 COLOR="#00ff00"><P ALIGN="CENTER">MEMBERSHIP IN THE FEDERATION</P>
</font></B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#00ffff">
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFCC00">Membership in the United Federation of 
  Planets is open to any sentient species willing to abide by the conditions and 
  obligations described in the Articles of Federation and the statutes constituting 
  Federation law. In practice, whenever such a race displays a sufficiently high 
  degree of cultural advancement and has demonstrated its peaceful intentions, 
  the Federations Department of Interstellar Relations contacts the candidate. 
  Specific criteria used to gauge a worlds suitability for membership can include 
  a high degree of literacy among the planet’s inhabitants, scientific progress 
  sufficiently advanced to accept the existence of other sentient beings, application 
  of the sciences to solve cultural problems or disadvantages, the existence of 
  a cultural philosophy that values individual life, and an acceptance of cultural 
  differences within the makeup of the social order. Though there is no single 
  prerequisite for admission to the Federation, the above-mentioned conditions 
  are among the major considerations.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFCC00">Once a planet is determined to be ready 
  for contact, representatives of the Federation journey to the prospective world 
  and, taking care to avoid unnecessary cultural shock, make their presence known 
  to the local planetary inhabitants. After establishing themselves as peaceful 
  emissaries, the Federation’s diplomatic representatives acquaint their counterparts 
  with Federation history, cultural heritage, and political freedoms, and offer 
  to establish friendly relations with them.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFCC00">If the planet’s populace accepts such 
  overtures, there follows a period of cultural exchange between Federation members 
  and the newly contacted world (typically one to three years), allowing each 
  side to learn about the other. Unless otherwise decreed by a special vote of 
  the Federation</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFCC00">Assembly, technological and scientific 
  exchanges are kept to a minimum. Following this trial period, the Department 
  of Interstellar Relations makes a final recommendation to a joint session of 
  the Federation Council and Assembly. Those assembled then vote to accept or 
  reject the candidate world's application for membership.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFCC00">If the new civilization is accepted into 
  the Federation, it receives either full or associate member status within the 
  Federation’s governmental system. Full-member worlds are accorded the right 
  to place a representative on the Federation Assembly, thus granting them an 
  equal voice in the drafting and passage of Federation legislation. Full-status 
  members may also join the Federation Security Council and be elected to administrative 
  and legislative positions within the Federation government, including the Federation 
  Council. Full-status members must make regular contributions to the Federation 
  Treasury, the exact amount being determined beforehand by members of the Department 
  of Finance. In<B> </B>addition, full-status members are requested to contribute 
  to financial appropriations voted by the Assembly in times of emergency.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFCC00">For cultural, political, or philosophical 
  reasons, a member civilization may sometimes object to contributing funds that 
  might, directly or indirectly, be used for military purposes. In such case, 
  that civilization receives associate-member status. Associate-member status 
  is also given automatically to all Federation colonies with populations of over 
  one million inhabitants. In the Federation government, associate members have 
  representatives in the Federation Assembly, but these representatives cannot 
  be elected to the Federation Council. Associate members may vote on issues pertaining 
  to the Assembly in general, and their representatives may hold positions within 
  the Judiciary or on special committees, but they have less influence than full 
  members.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFCC00">Whether full member or associate member 
  the newly admitted civilization is subject to and protected by the laws governing 
  the Federation, as determined by the Federation Assembly and ratified by the 
  Federation Council The society is Likewise entitled to Star Fleet protection 
  and any economic arid cultural advantages bestowed by membership. Most important, 
  the world maintains the right of self-government, the right to determine its 
  own cultural future, and the right to live in accordance with its own laws and 
  customs, free from external interference or coercion.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFCC00">Occasionally, a society or culture not 
  advanced enough to qualify for formal admission will require special consideration 
  by the Federation. The most recent case in point is that of Coridan, a planet 
  whose inhabitants suffered greatly from unrestricted mining operations (what 
  some <I>would </I>call depravations) by various Federation members as well as 
  Orion independents. In such cases, the Assembly may vole to grant Protectorate 
  Status to the planet, in effect placing a hands-off sign on the world. Often, 
  this status is applied to newly emerging civilizations under the doctrine of 
  the Prime Directive. The intention is to protect the natural and orderly cultural 
  development of a given world from outside interference or ‘contamination’.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFCC00">Although offering numerous advantages, 
  membership in the United Federation of Planets must be taken seriously. In accepting 
  the advantages of Federation benevolence, member worlds admittedly do so at 
  a price. They cannot develop an interstellar navy, but they may support a local 
  in-system fleet. Member worlds must adopt established Federation economic standards 
  when dealing with worlds outside their own systems. Not only does this include 
  incorporating standardized weights and measures, specific monetary systems, 
  and customs procedures, but also economic restrictions and sanctions against 
  other worlds. An example is the refusal to permit trade in Orion slaves anywhere 
  within Federation space. Although Star Fleet is pledged never to use coercive 
  force against a Federation member nor to allow aggression between members, member 
  worlds whose internal policies do not agree with those of the majority may be 
  subject to economic and cultural sanctions, whose result might seem oppressive.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFCC00">For these reasons, many eligible planets<B> 
  </B>within the Federation’s sphere of influence choose to remain independent. 
  Similarly, Federation representatives have not attempted to incorporate worlds 
  from the Triangle Zone, even though many of these qualify for membership. The 
  Federation tolerates these independent worlds as tong as their government’s 
  policies do not conflict with those of the Federation. Commercial and cultural 
  relations are maintained only it the civilization in question respects Federation 
  economic, political, and military interests. Delegations to independent worlds 
  are dispatched periodically to renew ties of friendship to monitor cultural 
  progress, or to renew offers of formal membership. Under no circumstances will 
  the Federation ever attempt to impose membership forcibly on a government that 
  cannot or will riot accept the obligations of membership.</font></P>
<P><font color="#FFCC00">Theoretically, a member world may withdraw from the Federation 
  when that world deems such action to be in its best interests. The first amendment 
  to the Articles of Federation specifically dictates that any alteration of membership 
  status requires a formal request for dissolution of membership and a two-thirds 
  vote of the Federation Assembly.</font></P>
