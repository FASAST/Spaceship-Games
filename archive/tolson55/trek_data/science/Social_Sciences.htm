<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFCC00" size="2">This large group of skills deals 
  with the institutions and functions of societies and with the interpersonal 
  relationships between individuals in those societies. Every Star Fleet officer 
  has training in these areas with respect to his own race, planet, and culture, 
  as well as in the laws and history of the Federation. Furthermore, all have 
  skill in at least one other area, and many have training in more than one area.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFCC00" size="2">Separate Skill Ratings must 
  be developed for each separate race and for each different field, such as the 
  examples listed below.</font></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFCC00"><I><B>Archaeology: 
  </b></i>Training involves the study of a race’s ancient cultures, their history, 
  and their lifestyles. It includes the study of applicable dead languages as 
  well as practice in making archaeological digs and in identifying and dating 
  relics and ruins. This skill could be used by a character attempting to decipher 
  runes or to determine the use of an alien artifact.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFCC00"><I><B>Economics: 
  </b></i>Training involves the study of the basic laws of supply and demand, 
  as well as the basics of trade, wealth, and the production, distribution, and 
  consumption of goods and services. Many officers in full-time services in the

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFCC00" size="2">chant Marine Command have training 
  in this field, and all private merchants probably do as well. This skill could 
  be used by characters dealing with a race’s economy in trade or in determining 
  the social conditions on a world.</font></P>
</FONT> 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFCC00"><I><B>Law (including 
  Federation Law): </b></i>Training involves the study of the codes, customs, 
  and rules of a society. Security Officers receive advanced training in Federation 
  law, as do officers attending Command School. The skill could be used by characters 
  dealing with a race’s legal system or in remembering an obscure law on one of 
  the Federation’s member planets.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFCC00"><I><B>Political 
  Science: </b></i>Training involves the study of a society’s politics and government. 
  It includes study of the way laws and policies are made, in the structure of 
  the government and its institutions, and in the ways political groups gain and 
  control power. The skill could be used by a character attempting to influence 
  a government, possibly modified by his Skill Rating in </font><font color="#FFCC00" size="2"><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Negotiations/Diplomacy.

<P><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFCC00">Training involves study of the 
  history and culture of a starfaring race. Communications Officers receive advanced 
  training in one or more races, and Command School gives additional training 
  in Federation history. The skill would be used by characters attempting to avoid 
  mistakes in manners or behavior on an alien world, or attempting to make sense 
  out of behavior they are witnessing.</font></P>
