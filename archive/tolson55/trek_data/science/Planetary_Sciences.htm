<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFCC00" size="2">This large group of sciences 
  deal with the structure and function of planetary materials a planet’s lithosphere 
  (including its geography and its rocks, minerals, ores, and fuel deposits), 
  its hydrosphere (including its oceans, lakes, and rivers), and its atmosphere 
  (including its weather and climate). All Star Fleet cadets are trained in one 
  of these sciences, and Science Officers frequently have professional-level training 
  in at least one. Separate Skill Ratings must be developed for each different 
  science, such as the examples listed below.</font></P>
</FONT> 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFCC00"><I><B>Geology: 
  </b></i>Training involves not only the study of such earth materials as rocks, 
  minerals, ores, and soil, but also the study of such landforms as mountains, 
  valleys, volcanoes, and beaches, and of the processes that create them. It also 
  includes extensive field experience in mineral and fossil identification, in 
  analyzing the geologic history of a region, and in geologic mapping. Geologists 
  can use their skill to determine the presence of a valuable ore or fuel deposit, 
  or to identify likely regions for earthquakes or volcanic activity.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFCC00"><I><B>Hydrology:&#9;</b></i>Training 
  involves the study of a planet’s water (or its substitute) as found on the planet’s 
  surface, beneath its surface, and in its atmosphere. It deals with the precipitation-river-ocean-evaporation 
  cycle, as well as with the chemical and physical nature of the water itself. 
  It also deals with oceanography and such topics as currents and waves, flooding, 
  and ice sheets and glaciers. Hydrologists can use their skill to help determine 
  the suitability of a planet for colonization, to discover underground water 
  sources, and so on. </font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFCC00"><I><B>Meteorology: 
  </b></i>Training includes the study of all atmospheric phenomena, including 
  weather (winds, storms, precipitation, temperature, etc.) and climate (the prevailing 
  weather conditions in an area). Meteorologists can use their skill to predict 
  the weather, or to determine the suitability of a planet’s climate for colonization, 
  for example.</font></P>
