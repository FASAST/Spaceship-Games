<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFCC00">This group of skills includes the study 
  of living things, both terrestrial and alien plants and animals, bacteria, fungi, 
  and other organisms. All Star Fleet officers have some training in one of these 
  sciences, and Science and Medical Officers have training in at least one, with 
  the likelihood of training in more than one and extensive training as well. 
  Separate Skill Ratings must be developed for each type of life science, such 
  as those examples listed below.</font></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFCC00"><I><B>Bionics:&#9;</b></i>Training 
  includes the study of how biological systems and functions can be applied to 
  engineering problems. Included are the physical melding of beings and machinery, 
  such as with artificial organs or Electro-mechanically enhanced senses. Bio-engineers 
  can use their skill to create </font><font size="2" color="#FFCC00">artificial 
  </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFCC00">organs and limbs.</font></P>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00">
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFCC00"><I><B>Botany:&#9;</b></i>Training includes 
  the study of plants, from simple algae to complex flowering and non flowering 
  varieties. It also includes such agricultural topics as growth mechanisms, genetics, 
  cross-fertilization, hybridization, and hydroponics (growth without soil). Most 
  botanists can recognize poisonous and edible plants, and from plants under cultivation 
  can deduce information about the technology, metabolism, and life-style of those 
  doing the agriculture.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFCC00"><I><B>Ecology:&#9;</b></i>Training includes 
  the study of how living things interact with their environment. Planetary ecologists 
  can determine if a planet is habitable, as well as the probable effects of colonization 
  on the planet’s life forms and environment. Ecologists can use their skill to 
  determine which, if any, plants and animals can become part of the food chains 
  of Federation or alien races.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFCC00"><I><B>Exobiology:&#9;</b></i>Training 
  includes the study of life forms alien to humanoid creatures. It involves the 
  study of non-carbon-based organisms, with life cycles that may not include nitrogen, 
  oxygen, or water. Exobiologists can use their skill to give information about 
  the structure and function of alien creatures and plants, perhaps even determining 
  that what appears to be non-living is in fact alive, but of a structure totally 
  new to the Federation.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFCC00"><I><B>Genetics:&#9;</b></i>Training includes 
  the study of heredity and variations in living things from one individual, group, 
  species, or generation to another. Genetic specialists added their skills to 
  projects like constructing The Genesis Device or breeding genetic ‘supermen’ 
  such as Kahn Noonian Singh.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFCC00"><I><B>Zoology:&#9;</b></i>Training includes 
  the study of animal life, with particular emphasis on the properties of and 
  characteristics exhibited by an animal, an animal type, or an animal population. 
  Zoologists can use their skill to recognize predators and prey, and they can 
  determine which animals are likely to be dangerous or beneficial to a landing 
  party.</font></P>
