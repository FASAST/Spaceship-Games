  <P><font color="#FFCC00">No interstellar vessel is flown totally by manual controls. 
    Only sophisticated computer technology allows the harnessing of the matter 
    / antimatter mix that powers Federation warp drives or the propulsion systems 
    of the other star faring races. Computer complexes control the systems for 
    interstellar navigation, weapons, life support, power flow, and almost every 
    other aspect of life aboard a starship. The central computer is capable of 
    translating languages instantly, of providing needed historical or cultural 
    data, of analyzing data and coming to conclusions based on such analysis, 
    and of monitoring every function of the ship.</font></P>
  <P><font color="#FFCC00">Because the functions of these computers overlap so 
    much, most ship designs find it best to run these controls through one central 
    computer. Star Fleet ships larger than shuttlecraft all have centralized computer 
    control. These Duotronic computers (so-called by their inventor, Dr. Richard 
    Daystrom) are not truly capable of independent thought, but they are the next 
    thing to it. In a very real sense, the central computer is the "brain" of 
    the ship — its most useful, and potentially its most vulnerable part.</font></P>
  <P><font color="#FFCC00">Large ships have terminals everywhere, including in 
    the quarters of department heads and other important officers. There are study 
    and recreational terminals in crew quarters on most ships. Of course, the 
    most sophisticated and versatile terminal, including reprogramming controls, 
    is on the bridge station of the Science Officer. The Science Officer is in 
    charge of all computer operations on large ships.</font></P>
  <P><font color="#FFCC00">In addition, reference and research data is stored 
    in computer memory banks far more compact and sophisticated than those in 
    use in the 1980s. The extent of knowledge in these library computer banks 
    varies from ship to ship, but the <I>Constitution </I>Class starships have 
    huge library banks that contain the entire body of factual knowledge known 
    to the Federation. (Think of the Library of Congress at your fingertips—just 
    a question away—and you'll have the right idea!) These memory banks also contain 
    the ship's technical, medical, scientific and recreational libraries, and 
    such information can be displayed on any terminal on the ship.</font></P>
  <P><font color="#FFCC00">These sophisticated computers make many of the ship's 
    routine functions almost automatic. This allows a large ship to operate with 
    just a skeleton crew, if necessary. It can also lead to problems, if the computer 
    is tampered with or damaged. Manual back-up controls are available for every 
    system, but they do not operate with the speed or the efficiency of the computer-controlled 
    methods.</font></P>
  <P><font color="#FFCC00">The <I>Enterprise </I>and similar starships have central 
    computers programmed to respond to voice commands. The computer is capable 
    of identifying a person from a voice pattern, and just as capable of denying 
    information to those persons it considers unauthorized. In addition, the computer 
    can respond with a human-like voice and speech mannerism.</font></P>
  <P><font color="#FFCC00">Many computer functions can be provided to landing 
    parties equipped with communications equipment and data-gathering devices. 
    A tricorder can feed data by communicator link to the ship's computer, and 
    the Science or Medical Officer using it can have the powerful ship's computer 
    at his or her fingertips.</font></P>
