</B><P>Phasers are the major shipborne weapons used by the Federation. They project a beam that can be set in a variety</P>
<P>Ship-mounted phasers, often mounted in pairs called 'phaser banks,' are actually armed and fired from phaser control rooms near the phaser banks themselves, but they can be aimed and activated from repeater controls on the bridge. Phaser operation depends on keeping the banks cooled with a special coolant gas, which is poisonous to humanoids, so phaser room duty is somewhat hazardous.</P>
<P>Usually phasers are used for starship combat, but they also can be directed against ground targets. When so used, they can be fired accurately to within a city block or so, and even more accuracy is possible if someone with an active communicator acts as a forward ground observer. When so used, they affect an area a half a city block across, and thus a starship could easily level a city in a matter of minutes with phasers alone!</P>
<P>The primary side arm of the Federation is a compact phaser unit with the same capabilities. It is discussed in the section on Sidearms.</P>
