  if any, is also provided.]</font></P>
<ol>
  <li><font color="#0000FF" size="2"><SMALL><FONT face=Arial>1 Captain-Jerrv Gout, 
    former starship Commander, has been promoted to Commodore and reassigned to 
    serve as Assistant Base Commandant at Star Base 18. [This should be of personal 
    interest to Commander Shy’aire. [The game master should present the information 
    in The Worst of Friends at this time.]</FONT></SMALL></font></li>
  <li><font color="#0000FF" size="2"><SMALL><FONT face=Arial>2 A report filed 
    by the USS Niwen reports the apparent presence of a secret Romulan installation 
    within the Romulan Neutral Zone. [This may indicate an increase in Romulan 
    activities, and could prove to be a prelude to overt hostilities.]</FONT></SMALL></font></li>
  <li><font color="#0000FF" size="2"><SMALL><FONT face=Arial>3 Star Fleet is making 
    plans to prepare for a Federation Galactic Conference. [This conference is 
    referred to briefly in STAR TREK IV. The Search For Spock.]</FONT></SMALL></font></li>
  <li><font color="#0000FF" size="2"><SMALL><FONT face=Arial>4 Operation Tactical 
    Encounters XX is concluded, and preliminary reports from Captain Sufik indicate 
    the exercise generally was a success.</FONT></SMALL></font></li>
  <li><font color="#0000FF" size="2"><SMALL><FONT face=Arial>5 Commander Mira 
    Romaine, the assistant curator of the Star Fleet Museum on Memory Alpha, suggests 
    the need for stricter security facilities after an abortive burglary. [This 
    is a strange report and might bear investigation at some future time.]</FONT></SMALL></font></li>
  <li><font color="#0000FF" size="2"><SMALL><FONT face=Arial>6 Commodore Mendez, 
    former Base Commandant of Star Base 23, has been transferred to Star Fleet 
    Intelligence Command. Commodore George Green, previously serving as Assistant 
    Base Commandant of Star Base 22, replaces her. [Green is known for being a 
    very forceful and militant officer, the kind of Commandant often sent into 
    an area where Star Fleet expects open hostilities.]</FONT></SMALL></font></li>
  <li><font color="#0000FF" size="2"><SMALL><FONT face=Arial>7 Commodore Gout, 
    upon the illness of Adm. Dan Foxworthy, replaces him as Acting Base Commandant 
    of Star Base 18. [This is simply more bad news for Shy’aire.)</FONT></SMALL></font></li>
  <li><font color="#0000FF" size="2"><SMALL><FONT face=Arial>8 Commander Krone, 
    commanding officer of the USS Hafkey is reported missing on Daran V after 
    his ship was detailed to conduct a covert investigation on Orion shipping. 
    [There may be some connection with other starship activities in that area.]</FONT></SMALL></font></li>
  <li><font color="#0000FF" size="2"><SMALL><FONT face=Arial>9 Numerous starships 
    are reassigned to duty as dignitary envoys for the Galactic Conference.</FONT></SMALL></font></li>
  <li><font color="#0000FF" size="2"><SMALL><FONT face=Arial>10 The Commander 
    of the USS Zirconian Star, a transport, reports the theft of a warp shuttle 
    and a large quantity of unrefined kironide from Platonius. [This is also quite 
    strange. With kironide's interesting powers, as described in the STAR TREKTV 
    episode 'Plato's Stepchildren', this may warrant future investigations.]</FONT></SMALL></font></li>
  <li><font color="#0000FF" size="2"><SMALL><FONT face=Arial>11 Adm. Foxworthy 
    accepts a medical retirement, and Gout formally replaces him as Base Commandant 
    of Star Base 18, a duty he has already assumed.</FONT></SMALL></font></li>
  <li><font color="#0000FF" size="2"><SMALL><FONT face=Arial>12 Operation Flame 
    Wall, a second large-scale fleet maneuver, begins under the command of Commodore 
    Green. [A second operation coming so closely after Operation White Water XX 
    is almost unheard of, even in this area of Federation space nearest the Klingon 
    Empire.]</FONT></SMALL></font></li>

<P><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF" size="2">41-55 Sensor Contact</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF" size="2">The Hastings makes sensor contact 
  with another ship or astrophysical phenomena. Roll 1D10 to determine the specific 
  encounter.</font></P>
<ol>
  <li><font color="#0000FF" size="2"><SMALL><FONT face=Arial>1-4 A sensor ‘ghost’ 
    is detected at extreme sensor range. A successful Skill Roll against the characters 
    rating in <I>Electronics Technology</I> verifies the sensors are operating 
    correctly. A successful Skill Roll against a characters rating in <I>Starship 
    Sensors</I> indicates the ghost is a ship pacing or on a parallel course with, 
    the Hastings. The ship does not respond to any subspace communication. Any 
    attempt to engage in combat will have to be judged by the game master.</FONT></SMALL></font></li>
  <li><font color="#0000FF" size="2"><SMALL><FONT face=Arial>[The Hastings and 
    the Elasi V-11 Valiant Class cruiser the Slasher are on a parallel course, 
    with the Elasi trailing. Place the Hastings within three hexes of one corner 
    of a Star field Map sheet and Slasher within three hexes of the opposite corner, 
    so that the Elasi ship is behind and following. Both ships have the same initial 
    facing and speed, determined by the current speed of the Hastings. This places 
    the Elasi ship in the Hastingss rear arc.]</FONT></SMALL></font></li>
  <li><font color="#0000FF" size="2"><SMALL><FONT face=Arial>5-6 An unusual sensor 
    reading Is detected. A successful Skill Roll against a characters rating in 
    Starship Sensors indicates it is a stealth device. The ship does not respond 
    to any subspace communication. The game master will have to judge any attempt 
    to engage in combat.</FONT></SMALL></font></li>
  <li><font color="#0000FF" size="2"><SMALL><FONT face=Arial>[Place the Hastings 
    in the center of one of the short sides of a Star field Map sheet. Place the 
    Elasi in any desired map hex 2D10 + 5 hexes from the Federation ship. Both 
    ships have the same Initial facing and speed, determined by the cruising speed 
    of the Hastings. This places the Elasi ship somewhere aft of the Hastings.]</FONT></SMALL></font></li>
  <li><font color="#0000FF" size="2"><SMALL><FONT face=Arial>7 An ion storm or 
    similar large astrogational hazard presents Itself. The Hastings has the choice 
    of avoiding the hazard, thus taking one additional week to reach SB 18, or 
    of travelling through the hazard. If they attempt the latter, the Helmsman 
    should make a Skill Roll against his rating In <I>Starship Helm Operation</I>. 
    If the roll is unsuccessful, the Hastings suffers 1D10+ 5 points of damage 
    on the forward shield.</FONT></SMALL></font></li>
  <li><font color="#0000FF" size="2"><SMALL><FONT face=Arial>8 A usually crowded 
    navigational ‘space lane’ has less traffic than normal, possibly allowing 
    the Hastings a short-cut. A successful Skill Roll against a character's rating 
    in <I>Astrogation</I> reduces the time needed to reach the ship's destination 
    by 0.5 weeks.</FONT></SMALL></font></li>
  <li><font color="#0000FF" size="2"><SMALL><FONT face=Arial>9-10 Another Federation 
    starship briefly crosses within sensor range. It relays customary ship-to-ship 
    greetings.</FONT></SMALL></font></li>

  specific event</font></P>
<ol>
  <li><font color="#0000FF" size="2"><SMALL><FONT face=Arial>1 It is Commander 
    Shy’aire’s birthday. On a ship of a couple hundred crewmen, somebody has a 
    birthday almost every day. Nevertheless, when the crew knows that it is the 
    Captain's birthday, it is common to have a large party, often arranged as 
    a surprise. The change in age should be logged.</FONT></SMALL></font></li>
  <li><font color="#0000FF" size="2"><SMALL><FONT face=Arial>2 It is Commander 
    Soronto’s birthday.</FONT></SMALL></font></li>
  <li><font color="#0000FF" size="2"><SMALL><FONT face=Arial>3 A message comes 
    from Star Fleet. After admirably performing his duties for an appropriate 
    amount of time, a member of the crew is granted a deserved promotion. The 
    ceremony is officiated by the Captain.</FONT></SMALL></font></li>
  <li><font color="#0000FF" size="2"><SMALL><FONT face=Arial>(NOTE: In addition 
    to any NPCs considered, Dr. Mclintoc (currently a Lcmdr.), and Lt. Wilkins

  <li><font color="#0000FF" size="2"><SMALL><FONT face=Arial>4 An enlisted crewman

  <li><font color="#0000FF" size="2"><SMALL><FONT face=Arial>6 Lt. Hall reports 
    an incident of fighting among the crewmen, with 1D10-5 injured persons. The

  <li><font color="#0000FF" size="2"><SMALL><FONT face=Arial>7 Dr. Mclintoc reports 
    increasing requests by crewmen for tranquilizers, indicating the deteriorating 
    state of crew morale.</FONT></SMALL></font></li>
  <li><font color="#0000FF" size="2"><SMALL><FONT face=Arial>8 According to Dr. 
    Mclintoc, it is time for the annual physicals for senior officers. The test 
    results show physical and psychological performance are below ideal levels, 
    due to fatigue.</FONT></SMALL></font></li>
  <li><font color="#0000FF" size="2"><SMALL><FONT face=Arial>9-10 Lt. Smythe reports 
    assorted supplies are missing from the fabricators. Nothing crucial has been 
    taken, but it is odd.</FONT></SMALL></font></li>
</ol>
<P><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF" size="2">76-85 Unusual Discovery</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF" size="2">While the crew performs their regular 
  duties, unusual situations occur. These experiences provide opportunities for 
  crew members to learn and improve their skills. Follow the steps listed below.</font></P>
<ol>
  <li><font color="#0000FF" size="2"><SMALL><FONT face=Arial>1. The game master 
    selects a player character, either randomly or deliberately.</FONT></SMALL></font></li>
  <li><font color="#0000FF" size="2"><SMALL><FONT face=Arial>2. Select a skill 
    that the player would use while performing duties or in which he had expressed 
    an Interest.</FONT></SMALL></font></li>
  <li><font color="#0000FF" size="2"><SMALL><FONT face=Arial>3. Provide simple 
    details or an explanation behind the situation.</FONT></SMALL></font></li>
  <li><font color="#0000FF" size="2"><SMALL><FONT face=Arial>4. Permit the character 
    to make a reverse skill roll against his current skill rating. If the roll 
    is successful, the character receives a permanent, 1D10-5 point increase (minimum 
    of 1 point) in that skill level.</FONT></SMALL></font></li>
  <li> 
    <ol>
      <li><font color="#0000FF" size="2"><SMALL><FONT face=Arial>Suggested areas 
        for improvement include all skills used in ship travel, such as <I>Astrogation, 
        Starship Helm Operation, Warp Drive Technology, Starship Sensors, Communication 
        Systems Operation</I> and many others. Also, characters studying the Four 
        Years War may receive skill points In <I>Racial Culture History</I>, <I>Federation</I>, 
        among other possibilities.</FONT></SMALL></font></li>
