<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> <FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE="2"><font color="#FFCC00">Star 
  Fleet Command is the largest single military force in the history of the major 
  interstellar powers. Established by the Articles of Federation, Star Fleet&#146;s 
  purpose is to provide common defense and security for the Federation&#146;s 
  member worlds, as well as to explore and investigate space. Constitutional safeguards 
  exist to prohibit the illegal use of any Star Fleet resource against one or 
  more members of the Federation. However, many individuals believe that the continued 
  increase of Star Fleet&#146;s personnel, combat-ready ships, and political influence 
  within the Federation bureaucracy may threaten the continued stability of the 
  Federation.</font></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> <font face="Arial" color="#FFCC00"><FONT SIZE="2">Detractors 
  of Star Fleet expansion point to the incidents surrounding the Scandal of Archimedes 
  of Stardate 1/7201. Prior to this date, mining interests on both Andor and Tellar 
  disputed the right to mine the resources of the planet Th&#146;allt in the Archimedes 
  system. The crux of the argument concerned whether or not Andor had exclusive 
  claim to the planet&#146;s wealth. As their survey teams had discovered the 
  planet about the same </FONT><FONT SIZE="1">time </FONT><FONT SIZE="2">as the 
  Andorians, the Tellarites claimed the right of equal opportunity. Eventually, 
  the matter was forwarded to the Department of Interstellar Trade and Commerce 
  for adjudication. Before this agency could act, however, Andorian Star Fleet 
  Admiral Hathari seized the initiative and began to detain forcibly Tellarite 
  merchant ships operating out of Th&#146;allt. He confiscated ore cargoes and 
  fired on Tellarite vessels refusing to stop and submit to search. Although Admiral 
  Hathari was later disciplined for his actions, and Star Fleet agreed to pay 
  Tellar extensive reparations for damages, the incident shows what could </FONT><FONT SIZE="1">occur 
  </FONT><FONT SIZE="2">if any portion of Star Fleet were ever employed irresponsibly.</FONT></font></P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT FACE="Arial">
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> <font face="Arial" color="#FFCC00"><FONT SIZE="2">Two lengthy 
  and costly wars with the Romulan and Klingon Empires have proven the necessity 
  of a strong defensive capability, which only Star Fleet can ensure. Moreover, 
  the presence of independent groups such as the Orion Colonies and the Asparaxian 
  Confederation requires that some force patrol these unstable locations. Nevertheless, 
  many civilized societies refrain </FONT><FONT SIZE="1">from joining </FONT><FONT SIZE="2">the 
  Federation because they are either philosophically or politically reluctant 
  to contribute finances to this </FONT><FONT SIZE="1">thinly </FONT><FONT SIZE="2">disguised 
  military arm of the Federation. Clearly, Star Fleet has sometimes been used 
  to enforce Federation policy, such as the ban on Orion slave trade.</FONT></font></P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT FACE="Arial">
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> <font face="Arial" color="#FFCC00"><FONT SIZE="2">Advocates 
  of a strong Star Fleet point to the enormous sacrifices that Star Fleet has 
  made and continues to make for the security and well-being of the Federation. 
  They also point out that the mix of non-Humanoid and Humanoid personnel in Star 
  Fleet deters any single power block or interest group from gaining undue influence. 
  Lastly, Star Fleet has always obeyed the government&#146;s efforts to economize 
  in times of peace by cuffing back fleet size, even if opposed to such measures.</FONT></font></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> <font face="Arial" color="#FFCC00"><FONT SIZE="2">Star Fleet 
  remains a mixed blessing, viewed as either a primary peace-keeper or a potential 
  disruptor of political and economic freedoms. It remains to be seen how the 
  Federation government will continue to use this willing (or unwilling) instrument 
  of its policies.</FONT></font></P>
  
<P ALIGN=CENTER> <B><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE="4"><font color="#00FF00">FUNDING 
  THE FLEET</font></FONT></FONT></B></P>
  
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> <FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE="2"><font color="#FFCC00">Star 
  Fleet Command is currently responsible for over 12,000 capital ships and over 
  20,000 auxiliary and support vessels of various types. These craft range in 
  size from small, fully-automated ore carriers to <I>Excelsior </I>Class baffle-ships 
  incorporating the latest Federation technology. In addition, Star Fleet is responsible 
  for maintaining several star bases as well as hundreds of smaller support, repair, 
  and construction facilities. As might be expected, the financial necessities 
  of maintaining such a wide array of men and materiel is beyond the normal capabilities 
  of any single agency. Star Fleet receives its annual operational funding through 
  the sources described below.</font></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> <font face="Arial" color="#FFCC00"><FONT SIZE="2">It should 
  be remembered that the Federation is Star Fleet&#146;s major source of revenue 
  and, more importantly, trained manpower. When new technology or weaponry calls 
  for new vessel designs or classes, Star Fleet must make a special request of 
  the Federation Assembly for extraordinary funding. Likewise, whenever normal 
  fleet size must be expanded, such as during times of war, Star Fleet is required 
  to make a similar request to the Assembly.</FONT></font></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> <font face="Arial" color="#FFCC00"><FONT SIZE="2"><B><font color="#009999">UFP 
  BUDGETARY CONTRIBUTION</font></B></FONT></font></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> <font face="Arial" color="#FFCC00"><FONT SIZE="2">Despite the 
  misgivings of various members, the Federation remains committed to use Star 
  Fleet for the defense and security of its member societies. The Federation Assembly 
  limits the amount of governmental support designated by the Federation Council. 
  Star Fleet Command receives less than half its total funding from direct Federation 
  contributions. In recent years, the average sum contributed by the government 
  has amounted to between 40 and 45 percent of Star Fleet&#146;s total financial 
  resources.</FONT></font></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> <font face="Arial" color="#FFCC00"><FONT SIZE="2"><B><font color="#009999">CUSTOMS 
  DUTIES AND RELATED EXPENSES</font></B></FONT></font></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> <font face="Arial" color="#FFCC00"><FONT SIZE="2">In many parts 
  of the Federation, there are no cargo or passenger carriers to provide transportation 
  for local Federation members. In such cases, Star Fleet supplies such transportation 
  for a nominal fee. Usually based on local financial need and ability to pay, 
  these arrangements cost less than comparable civilian rates.</FONT></font></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> <font face="Arial" color="#FFCC00"><FONT SIZE="2">A private 
  corporation or citizen may occasionally call upon Star Fleet to transport secret 
  or extremely valuable cargoes from one star system to another. In such cases, 
  similar customs fees are invoked. If no Federation customs or port officials 
  exist within a system, Star Fleet will regulate cargoes between different systems, 
  imposing local customs duties where applicable. Together, these various sources 
  account for about ten percent of Star Fleet&#146;s annual budget.</FONT></font></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> <font face="Arial" color="#FFCC00"><FONT SIZE="2"><B><font color="#009999">STAR 
  BASE PRODUCTION</font></B></FONT></font></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> <font face="Arial" color="#FFCC00"><FONT SIZE="2">Star Fleet 
  maintains numerous star bases at critical points within Federation space to 
  defend planetary systems and to support Star Fleet operations in the vicinity. 
  Such star bases are self-sufficient centers of military and civilian activities. 
  They can also be commercial centers capable of supplying the industrial needs 
  of local planetary systems. Except in regions where major planetary trade centers 
  already exist, Star Fleet allows star base commanders to commit base resources 
  toward manufacturing numerous trade and commercial articles to help develop 
  local worlds. Often, a local planetary governor will request such activities, 
  conducting extensive trade with the star base for a certain good that his world 
  does not possess. Star base production accounts for nearly 30 percent of Star 
  Fleet&#146;s annual revenues.</FONT></font></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> <font face="Arial" color="#FFCC00"><FONT SIZE="2"><B><font color="#009999">PLANETS 
  FOR SALE</font></B></FONT></font></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> <font face="Arial" color="#FFCC00"><FONT SIZE="2">Every year, 
  Star Fleet survey teams discover many uncharted planets in unexplored areas 
  of space. Following a formal geological survey by Star Fleet personnel, the 
  survey team forwards its findings to the Department of Colonization. It sometimes 
  happens that a newly discovered Class M world possesses no economic or industrial 
  potential, and neither private, commercial, nor colonial interests claim it. 
  It is Federation policy that if no one claims </FONT><FONT SIZE="1">the </FONT><FONT SIZE="2">planet 
  in a year&#146;s time, jurisdiction over it falls to Star Fleet. Planet-side 
  star bases may be constructed on such worlds, but occasionally they are sold 
  to wealthy private citizens. (Flint&#146;s World is a case in point.) The planet 
  then becomes the personal property of the new owner, and Star Fleet compensated 
  accordingly. The Federation Assembly accepts this practice as a legitimate means 
  of collecting money that would otherwise have to come from member contributions.</FONT></font></P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT FACE="Arial">
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> <font face="Arial" color="#FFCC00"><FONT SIZE="2">Within the 
  last two decades, there have been 118 such sales, not all of which resulted 
  in actual occupation and/or habitation of the planet. The private sale of Star 
  Fleet-owned planets accounts for over ten percent of Star Fleet&#146;s annual 
  budget.</FONT></font></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> <font face="Arial" color="#FFCC00"><FONT SIZE="2">Despite the 
  best efforts of Federation politicians and diplomats, a large number of independent 
  and hostile planetary governments sanction pirate activities against shipping 
  interests within the borders of Federation space. In recognition of its efforts 
  to eradicate such marauders, the Federation permits Star Fleet to confiscate 
  and sell any seized contraband vessel engaged in piracy against Federation civilians. 
  The Department of Interstellar Trade and Commerce auctions off such vessels 
  and their cargoes, then turns over the proceeds to Star Fleet Command. Revenues 
  received in this manner account for roughly five percent of Star Fleet&#146;s 
  annual operating budget.</FONT></font></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> <font face="Arial" color="#FFCC00"><FONT SIZE="2"><B><font color="#009999">PRIVATE

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> <font face="Arial" color="#FFCC00"><FONT SIZE="2">Some planetary 
  governments have decreed that half of all contributions made by individual corporations 
  and private citizens to the Star Fleet general operations fund are taxdeductIble. 
  Corporations making such deductions must be chartered by the Federation&#146;s 
  Securities and Exchange Commission. Such contributions account for about five 
  percent of Star Fleet annual revenues.</FONT></font></P>
