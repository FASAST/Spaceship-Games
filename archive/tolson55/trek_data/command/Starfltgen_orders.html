  <font size="2" color="#FFCC00">As the right of each sentient species to live 
  in accordance with its normal cultural evolution is considered sacred, no Starfleet 
  personnel may interfere with the normal and healthy development of alien life 
  and culture. Such interference includes introducing superior knowledge, strength, 
  or technology to a world whose society is incapable of handling such advantages 
  wisely. Starfleet personnel may not violate this Prime Directive, even to save 
  their lives and/or their ship, unless they are acting to right an earlier violation 
  or an accidental contamination of said culture. This directive takes precedence 
  over any and all other considerations, and carries with it the highest moral 
  obligation. <BR>

  Federation vessel may take appropriate action to safeguard the lives and property 
  of Federation members. In such cases, the commander may use his discretion in
