<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#00FF00"><font size=+3>Articles
of Federation</font></font></font></center>

<p><br>
<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#00FFFF"><font size=-1>The driving force
behind the United Federation of Planets is a philosophical and political
document known as the Articles of Federation. Established on Stardate 0/8706.06,
the Articles of Federation serve both as a statement of mutual understanding
and unity and as a collection of guidelines to be applied rigorously. They
represent the democratic ideals of each of its founding members’ civilizations
and their commitment to the preservation of galactic peace and security.
Documents such as the United Earth Constitution, the Centauri Concordium,
the Andorian Pledge of Triumphant Security, the Statutes of Alpha ill,
and the Fundamental Declaration of the Martian Colonies helped form the
underlying principles drafted into the Articles.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#00FFFF"><font size=-1>The Federations
charter is composed of 109 articles divided into 16 separate chapters.
As it is impossible to consider each individual article here, following
is a summary of their provisions arid specifications. The summary is taken
directly from the text of the original document currently on display at
Memory Alpha.</font></font></font>

<center>
<p><b><font face="Arial"><font color="#00FFFF"><font size=-1>THE PURPOSE
AND PRINCIPLES OF THE FEDERATION</font></font></font></b></center>

<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#00FFFF"><font size=-1>That these member
races <i>are </i>joining together in political and social union reflects
their desire for mutual security as well as their sincere belief that they
can advance the conditions of life for all sentient life forms throughout
the galaxy. To this end, the United Federation of Planets is hereby established
to preserve interstellar peace, to coordinate galactic exploration, to
deter would-be aggressors, and to lend mutual support for the advancement
of all member races without distinction or qualification.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#00FFFF"><font size=-1><b>CHAPTER TWO</b>,

<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#00FFFF"><font size=-1>Membership is
extended to the original founding members as of this Stardate 0/8706.06.
In addition, membership shall be open to any and all societies willing
to abide by the conditions of federation specified herein, contingent on
the decision of the Federation Assembly and at the recommendation of the
Federation Council. The Assembly may suspend membership for a civilization
at the request of the Council and may impose permanent expulsion if necessary.</font></font></font>

organizational bodies of the Federation shall include the following: the
Federation Assembly, the Federation Council, provision for a Federation
Economic and Social Development Organization, a Trusteeship Council, a
supreme judicial system, a secretariat made up of individual governmental
departments, and a military body known as Star Fleet Command, to be composed
of each member planet’s navies for purposes of mutual defense. Additional
organizations or agencies may be designated as the need arises. There shall
be no restrictions with respect to gender or social origin for eligibility
in any of these Federation-affiliated bodies.</font></font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial"><font color="#00FFFF"><font size=-1>CHAPTER FOUR,

<p><b><font face="Arial"><font color="#00FFFF"><font size=-1>THE FEDERATION
ASSEMBLY</font></font></font></b></center>

<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#00FFFF"><font size=-1>The Federation
Assembly shall be open to all members of the Federation and shall hold
discussions on any question pertaining to the safety and/or welfare of
member races within the Federation or of the Federation itself. Each member
planet shall have one vote, and all proposals of the Assembly will require
a two-thirds majority vote to be enacted. The Assembly shall also require
the Federation Secretariat to report to the Assembly on matters of concern
at periodic intervals. The Assembly has the authority to make recommendations
to the Federation Council when such recommendations advance interstellar
cooperation and ensure individual rights of Federation citizens. The Assembly
is empowered to approve or to reject the Federations budget and shall decree
the amount of financial responsibility each member planet shall receive.
Should such financial responsibilities not be met, the Assembly may, by
a majority vote, act to suspend temporarily that member’s right to vote
on matters before the Assembly. The Assembly shall meet at specific intervals
or as circumstances may require. This body is also empowered to authorize
the formation of organizational bodies not previously established by a
majority vote.</font></font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial"><font color="#00FFFF"><font size=-1>CHAPTER FIVE,

shall consist of eleven members, five of which are permanent members and
the rest being nonpermanent members sitting on the Council for a period
of three years. Each council member shall have one vote. The permanent
members will consist of one representative from each of the original founding
members. The remainder are to be elected by the Assembly. The head of the
Council will be selected from among his peers and will receive the title
of President of the Council. The Federation Council will be responsible
for maintaining the peace and security of the Federation, and may pass
resolutions with the full weight of Federation law as necessary to ensure
the safety of the Federation. A majority vote is required to implement
any decision by the Council. Unlike the Federation Assembly, the Federation
Council is to be in continuous session and may meet at any location as
may be required. Like the Assembly, the Council can, by majority vote,
establish other organizations or governmental bodies as the need arises.</font></font></font>

<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#00FFFF"><font size=-1>The Articles
of Federation recognizes the likelihood of major disputes arising between
Federation members or between members and non-members, either of which
may threaten the peace and security of the Federation. In such cases, any
member or non-member may bring such matters to either the Federation Council
or Assembly for mediation, given that those involved agree in advance to
accept the Federation’s impartial resolution of the affair. If necessary,
such matters may be referred to the Federation Judiciary for further arbitration.
Should the Federation Assembly be called upon to hear said dispute, the
Assembly can make formal recommendations to the Council for a final disposition
of the matter. Upon due impartial consideration, the Council shall make
a final disposition of the dispute, which shall be binding on all parties.</font></font></font>

ACTS OF AGGRESSION</font></font></font></b></center>

<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#00FFFF"><font size=-1>Whenever there
is clear evidence of hostile acts being carried out against one or more
members of the Federation, the Federation Council is empowered to decide
what actions are appropriate to deal with the situation, short of using
armed force. The Council’s response may include, but is not limited to,
the imposition of economic sanctions and the interruption of trade and/or
cultural exchange between member worlds. If such actions are considered
inadequate to the existing threat, the Federation Council may then call
upon Star Fleet Command to restore peace and security. In the event a Federation
member is the originator of such aggression, no use of force shall be employed,
unless said member forfeits the opportunity to negotiate a settlement before
the Federation Assembly.</font></font></font>

for a common defense, Star Fleet Command is hereby created to coordinate
the armed forces of the Federation, subject to the control of the Federation
Council. This force shall consist of contributions of personnel and materiel
from the original member worlds. A central training center will be established
to supply the ongoing needs of the fleet. Further expansions of the fleet
will be consistent with the needs of the Federation, and will include considerations
of exploration and scientific inquiry as well as the maintenance of a strong
military presence.</font></font></font>

<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#00FFFF"><font size=-1>In addition to
maintaining internal peace and security from external threats, one of the
Federation’s aims shall be the economic stability and social advancement
of its members. To this end, the members of the Federation pledge themselves
to pursue the following goals: the recognition of the rights of individual
sentient beings throughout the galaxy, the economic, educational, and social
progress of fellow members, and the continued understanding and respect
for racial differences.</font></font></font>

aims expressed in the preceding articles, the Federation government shall
establish a council that shall evaluate economic and social conditions
on member and non-member planets within the Federation. This council shall
coordinate actions with other governmental organizations to promote economic
and social welfare of the Federation, with particular emphasis given to
upholding individual rights. In the event of clear evidence of individual

TRUSTEESHIP</font></font></font></b></center>

<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#00FFFF"><font size=-1>In the interests
of interstellar peace and economic and social evolution, when sentient
races are discovered in adjoining regions of space and if said races have
not yet attained a competent measure of self-government for whatever reason,
the Federation has the right to defend and protect such races. Any such
action will be in accordance with the provisions of the Articles of Federation,
ensuring due respect for other life forms. ~d. Note: This chapter serves
as the philosophical basis for granting protectorate status to various
worlds whenever that world’s normal development is threatened.]</font></font></font>

a given world or society is under the specifications of the Prime Directive
or quarantined due to protectorate status, such worlds shall be administered
by a special Federation council of trustees designated by the Federation
Assembly. The trustees will oversee the development of such worlds over
an extended period of time, periodically visit the planet in question,
and report on local conditions to the Federation Assembly at periodic intervals,
with recommendations as to the continuing disposition of such worlds. Whenever
more than one planet is designated as a protectorate or is otherwise protected
under the provisions of the Prime Directive, a separate trusteeship council
shall be established to administer each world accordingly.</font></font></font>

of bureaucratic efficiency, the principal administrative obligations of
the Federation shall be divided among various departmental bodies, each
headed by a duly appointed director, which shall collectively constitute
the Federation Secretariat. Each individual department is responsible for
reporting to the Federation Assembly on matters pertaining to their specific
areas and in such instances where special circumstances may warrant. Each
department may in turn recommend to the Federation Assembly or the Council
the creation of subordinate bodies under their control to maximize governmental
efficiency and/or to deal with specific problems or conditions as may arise.</font></font></font>
