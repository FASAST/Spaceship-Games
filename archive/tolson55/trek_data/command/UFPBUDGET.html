<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4 COLOR="#00ff00"><P ALIGN="CENTER">UFP BUDGETARY CONTRIBUTION</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#00ffff">
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFCC00">Despite the misgivings of various members, 
  the Federation remains committed to use Star Fleet for the defense and security 
  of its member societies. The Federation Assembly limits the amount of governmental 
  support designated by the Federation Council. Star Fleet Command receives less 
  than half its total funding from direct Federation contributions. In recent 
  years, the average sum contributed by the government has amounted to between 
  40 and 45 percent of Star Fleet’s total financial resources.</font></P>
<B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#009999">CUSTOMS DUTIES AND RELATED EXPENSES</font></P>
</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFCC00">In many parts of the Federation, there 
  are no cargo or passenger carriers to provide transportation for local Federation 
  members. In such cases, Star Fleet supplies such transportation for a nominal 
  fee. Usually based on local financial need and ability to pay, these arrangements 
  cost less than comparable civilian rates.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFCC00">A private corporation or citizen may 
  occasionally call upon Star Fleet to transport secret or extremely valuable 
  cargoes from one star system to another. In such cases, similar customs fees 
  are invoked. If no Federation customs or port officials exist within a system, 
  Star Fleet will regulate cargoes between different systems, imposing local customs 
  duties where applicable. Together, these various sources account for about ten 
  percent of Star Fleet’s annual budget.</font></P>
<B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#009999">STAR BASE PRODUCTION</font></P>
</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFCC00">Star Fleet maintains numerous star bases 
  at critical points within Federation space to defend planetary systems and to 
  support Star Fleet operations in the vicinity. Such star bases are self-sufficient 
  centers of military and civilian activities. They can also be commercial centers 
  capable of supplying the industrial needs of local planetary systems. Except 
  in regions where major planetary trade centers already exist, Star Fleet allows 
  star base commanders to commit base resources toward manufacturing numerous 
  trade and commercial articles to help develop local worlds. Often, a local planetary 
  governor will request such activities, conducting extensive trade with the star 
  base for a certain good that his world does not possess. Star base production 
  accounts for nearly 30 percent of Star Fleet’s annual revenues.</font></P>
<B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#009999">PLANETS FOR SALE</font></P>
</B></FONT>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFCC00">Every year, Star 
  Fleet survey teams discover many uncharted planets in unexplored areas of space. 
  Following a formal geological survey by Star Fleet personnel, the survey team 
  forwards its findings to the Department of Colonization. It sometimes happens 
  that a newly discovered Class M world possesses no economic or industrial potential, 
  and neither private, commercial, nor colonial interests claim it. It is Federation 
  policy that if no one claims </font><font face="Arial" size="1" color="#FFCC00">the 
  </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFCC00">planet in a year’s time, 
  jurisdiction over it falls to Star Fleet. Planet-side star bases may be constructed 
  on such worlds, but occasionally they are sold to wealthy private citizens. 
  (Flint’s World is a case in point.) The planet then becomes the personal property 
  of the new owner, and Star Fleet compensated accordingly. The Federation Assembly 
  accepts this practice as a legitimate means of collecting money that would otherwise 
  have to come from member contributions.</font></P>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#00ffff">
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFCC00">Within the last two decades, there have 
  been 118 such sales, not all of which resulted in actual occupation and/or habitation 
  of the planet. The private sale of Star Fleet-owned planets accounts for over 
  ten percent of Star Fleet’s annual budget.</font></P>
<B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#009999">COMMERCE PROTECTION</font></P>
</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFCC00">Despite the best efforts of Federation 
  politicians and diplomats, a large number of independent and hostile planetary 
  governments sanction pirate activities against shipping interests within the 
  borders of Federation space. In recognition of its efforts to eradicate such 
  marauders, the Federation permits Star Fleet to confiscate and sell any seized 
  contraband vessel engaged in piracy against Federation civilians. The Department 
  of Interstellar Trade and Commerce auctions off such vessels and their cargoes, 
  then turns over the proceeds to Star Fleet Command. Revenues received in this 
  manner account for roughly five percent of Star Fleet’s annual operating budget.</font></P>
<B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#009999">PRIVATE CONTRIBUTIONS</font></P>
</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFCC00">Some planetary governments have decreed 
  that half of all contributions made by individual corporations and private citizens 
  to the Star Fleet general operations fund are taxdeductIble. Corporations making 
  such deductions must be chartered by the Federation’s Securities and Exchange 
  Commission. Such contributions account for about five percent of Star Fleet 
  annual revenues.</font></P>
