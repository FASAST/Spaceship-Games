</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00ffff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PLANETARY DESCRIPTION</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Arken Ills a small, very dense world that orbits the two suns Arken A and B once every 200 standard days. The summer season hits swiftly, scorching the planet’s surface but lasting only 20 days. Following this is the stormy fall season, lasting roughly 80 days. The winter season is extremely harsh, freezing the planet’s seas for about 20 days. This is followed by spring, which, like fall, creeps in very slowly and lasts about 80 days. Surface temperatures at the planet’s equator range from —25° C. to -10° C. in the wintertime, and from 20° C. to 50° C. in the summer.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Arken II is not native to the Arken system. Scientists believe that when its original star exploded, the planet was flung into interstellar space. Eventually, it drifted into the still-forming Arken system, where it was caught by the gravitational pull of the two young stars. The intense heart generated by these suns fused Arken II’s sandy surface into a thick transparent crust. Eventually, underground rivers and lakes washed away much of the sand beneath these glass plains, and it was in these lakes that life formed.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00ffff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RACIAL DESCRIPTION</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Arkenites are an aquatic race of Humanoids easily recognized by their hairless, bulbous heads and fin-like ears. They are very tall, averaging around 2.2 meters high, and their glassy, deep-set ayes vary from dark green to amber. Arkenites are weaker than Humans, but are as intelligent and lucky. Arkenites do not practice psionics, but a few psionically talented individuals are known to exist.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All Arkenites wear a special sensory aid on their heads, improving the individual’s sense of balance and direction. Although they are necessary only when off Arken II, most Arkenites wear the device at all times because it enhances coordination, making the average Arkenite much more dexterous than most Humans.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although a long-time member of the Federation, there is still much to be learned about this reserved race. Their culture is oriented toward the group rather than the individual. Emphasis is placed on being a part of a <I>Sia Lenthar, </I>an Arkenite word meaning "group" or "pack". The larger or more unusual the group, the higher the esteem felt by that member. There is no rivalry between groups as this would diminish the importance of being part of the common race.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00ffff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RACIAL HISTORY</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Arkenites are descendants of aquatic life. Though they have evolved into air-breathing creatures, they still retain some of the features of their aquatic ancestors.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ancient Arkenite society was made up of thousands of migrant groups that roamed the planet in search of food and safety. Later, a powerful group called the <I>Sia Cathtec, </I>or "group of dominant power", assumed control of the other groups. During the early part of their reign, they established a social order, with themselves in the ruling class and everyone else in the common class. Eventually, they created another class consisting of those Arkenite commoners who distinguished themselves by their efforts to aid the ruling class. This middle class served the leaders directly, working as guards, assistants, and servants.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A few centuries after their rise to power, the members of the <I>Sia Cathtec </I>began to grow restless and argue among themselves. After one of their own was killed during an argument, they decided to settle arguments with the lives of commoners. Each leader received equal numbers of common</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Arkenites and formed them into armies. Whenever leaders disagreed, <I>they </I>would send their armies into battle to determine who was right.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having adapted well to being part of a single large group, the common class did not take well to being split up into smaller groups. Working as a single entity, they simply refused to accept the further authority of the <I>Sia Cathtec. </I>Although the ruling class attempted to force the populace to obey, the ruling class had lost their leverage. Eventually, without anyone to support or provide for them, the once-powerful dominant group died out completely. The commoners created new leadership, but such leaders were more like servants to the common group.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While forging their interstellar empire, the Andorians subjugated the Arkenites. After the establishment of the UFP, the Andorians themselves sent a diplomatic ship <I>to </I>Arken II to establish peaceful relations and to offer membership into the UFP. After much discussion and arguments within their leadership, the Arkenites decided to accept full-status membership.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00ffff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PLACE IN THE FEDERATION</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Arkenites are often encountered in scientific teams, on trading ships, and in Star Fleet. Many Arkenite trading ships ply the space lanes. These crews are very close and work extremely well together. Their efficiency rivals that of even the most disciplined of Star Fleet crews.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As such a career choice is unusual by Arkenite standards, few Arkenites become members of Star Fleet. These few adopt the crew of their ship as their own group. They consider physiological differences to be meaningless, using other means to separate their group from others (such as Star Fleet versus civilian, officer versus enlisted, and so on). This has made the Arkenites among the least prejudiced races serving in the Fleet. However, they are extremely suspicious of non-Federation races and will never treat a member of such a race as part of their group. This has been the primary factor keeping Arkenites from receiving command-level positions in Star Fleet. Most Arkanites are rather poor leaders anyway, as they tend to be uncomfortable in independent positions. However, as secondary officers and enlisted personnel, they excel.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most Arkenites in Star Fleet do not take great offense at being referred to as alien; they will simply correct the being who makes the error. However, a few will become distressed at being called alien. Such beings have been knon to sulk for days at being cast out.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00ffff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SPECIAL NOTE ON ARKENITE PHYSIOLOGY</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The distinctively bulbous head of the Arkanite contains a complex system of sensory input organs. These organs are very sensitive to changes in temperature, pressure, and magnetic fields. Though very nearsighted, they possess an omni-directional auditory system capable of perceiving frequencies too high for most races to hear. This built-in sonar gives them a keen sense of motion and distance, but does not provide details about distant objects. However, it does make sneaking up on an Arkenite extremely difficult. To maintain their sense of balance, the Arkenites have an organ that orients itself to their planet’s magnetic field. This sense can be disrupted by other magnetic fields and is, of course, disrupted when away from Arken II. When this occurs, the Arkenite experiences vertigo.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This vertigo has been a tremendous hindrance to their technological development. After a time, this was overcome by the development of a device known as an <I>Anlac’ven. </I>Worn over the head, this U-shaped device creates a tiny magnetic field that provides the user with a false sense of balance. Microcircuits alter the magnetic fields to give the wearer continual feedback on his surroundings. In fact, these devices are extremely sensitive to movement, providing the wearer with a perfect sense of balance and direction.</P>
