<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PLANETARY DESCRIPTION</P><DIR>
<DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Kashet is a small, Ten-an-like planet in a dual star system that is currently experiencing an ice age. It is the home of a reptilian race that adapted to the ice age by building gigantic domed enclosures that artificially maintain tropical conditions year-round. Mammoth underground passageways and tunnels throughout the equatorial region interconnect these city centers. Current census estimates number the city-based Kasheeta population at between six and seven million inhabitants.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00ffff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RACIAL DESCRIPTION</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Though the Kasheeta resemble the Gorn, they are an independently evolved race. The Kasheeta are not as warlike as the Gorn. Within the last 200 years, they have overcome their aggressive tendencies. Although female Kasheeta are notoriously arrogant and are quick to take offense at the slightest provocation, they prefer non-violent resolution to conflict.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Discovered almost eleven years ago, the Kasheeta are the newest addition to the Federation. They are roughly two-and-a-half meters tall at full adulthood. Males are distinguished by dull-green coloration, and females are predominantly bright green or reddish-green. Some Kasheeta, including the royal family, have neck scales of a bright bluish tone, which denotes (or so it is claimed) superior breeding. All Kasheeta have a bony, ridge-like structure at the base of the neck. Reputedly, this bone contains medicinal properties worth quite a few credits on various Triangle worlds.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When first introduced, a Kasheetan will seem aloof and arrogantly indifferent to outsiders, reflecting a centuries-old distrust of anyone not immediately recognizable as a friend. Despite this, Kasheetans are capable of expressing genuine friendship bordering on the obsessive. They frequently give gifts to prove their good intentions (and expect similar actions in return).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Kashet has a rigid social structure ruled by a matriarchy, the H’Jarilx dynasty. Under the direction of the Empress of the Domed Cities, Kasheetans practice a selective birth control program designed to enhance feminine qualities at the expense of less desirable males. As one might expect, all Kasheetan representatives to the Federation are female. Male Kasheetans are relegated to second-class citizenship. They provide manual and domestic labor, with little expectation of advancement within the social order. Even entrance into the elite warrior class is now reserved to the smaller, less powerful females. In some cities, it is illegal to extend basic literacy to males.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00ffff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RACIAL HISTORY</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Kasheetan records indicate that the planet’s social order was at one time completely opposite from its present system. Roughly 300 years ago, a male-dominated tribal society controlled the planet, holding female Kasheetans in general disrespect. The planet’s tribes were constantly warring among themselves for control of the shrinking farmlands and industrial bases. At this time, Kasheetan science was sufficiently developed to detect the onset of a new ice age (possibly hastened by the extended use of chemical weapons in the upper atmosphere). However, the tribal leaders ignored the evidence and elected to continue warring. When the glaciers descended upon them, threatening the race with extinction, the females staged a social revolution, overthrowing male leaders of the planet’s central</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">tribes in favor of a female-dominated order. The newly elected matriarchy acted quickly to build an extensive network of domed cities to ensure the race’s survival against the approaching ice age. However, a few tribes refused to forsake their lifestyle and accept the new social order. Hundreds of thousands of Kasheeta remained outside the domed cities, despite the deteriorating climate. Many still remain along the fringes of the planet’s glaciers, adapting as best they can and occasionally mounting raids against the planet’s cultural centers.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The government of Kashet centers on a matriarchy with the ruler of the planet, the Empress of the Domed Cities, at the apex. Below her, prominent family lines provide each city with a governor responsible for her city and the surrounding zones of arable territory. The governors meet monthly in the planet’s capital of lo’ Luth to do homage to their queen and to recommend positions for other females. The educational system is designed to maintain both the primacy of Kasheetan females as well as the cultural diversity of each city.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Kasheeta have a short life spans (roughly between 20 to 30 standard years), Kasheetan science deals primarily with the advancement of medicine. Of all the Federation representatives sent to Kashet, physicians and healers receive the most respect and admiration.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00ffff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PLACE IN THE FEDERATION</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Kashet received associate member status in the Federation within the last year. The Empress of The Domed Cities has recently concluded trade agreements with Andoian mining concerns, permitting them to extract radioactives in exchange for modern power plants and various support technologies. Several female Kasheetas from the royal family have been selected for the Star Fleet Academy. Plans are underway to house a permanent Federation delegation on Kashet within the next year, contingent on the Empress’ permission to construct an astronomical research/support facility in the isis Kash system. Additional trade concessions are expected as Kashet becomes integrated into the mainstream of Federation cultural and political concerns.</P></FONT></BODY>
