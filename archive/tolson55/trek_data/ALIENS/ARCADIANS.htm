<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PLANETARY DESCRIPTION</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Arcadia is a mild, temperate world with slightly higher oxygen content than that of Terra. Covered almost entirely by water, Arcadia is home to a species of intelligent aquatic mammalians known as the Arcadians. That portion of the planet not covered by water is comprised mostly of numerous islands and small archipelagos; two small continents lie near the southern pole. Most Arcadians reside in small cities built on the island chains. In addition, the Arcadians have constructed numerous artificial island masses that move about the planet with the changing of the seasons. Current estimates place Arcadian population at three to four billion inhabitants, though the possible presence of underwater communities makes accurate predications impossible at this time.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00ffff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RACIAL DESCRIPTION</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A sentient species resembling Terran dolphins, Arcadians are a race of omnivorous, pacifistic, and sea-going mammals that live off sea-borne plankton, though their physiological makeup permits them to photosynthesize a limited amount of sustenance as well. Grouped in loose social collections of several hundred to several thousand beings, most Arcadians live on land and in the planet’s oceans. Evidence suggests a short life span, somewhere between four and six standard decades long. Their pacifistic nature and the lack of predators have allowed the Arcadians to develop the beginnings of a technological society based primarily on applied physics and mathematics.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Arcadians’ piercing, gray-blue eyes are usually covered by a thin membrane that offers added protection against the solar radiation filtering through the planet’s thin atmosphere. Typical Arcadians range in height from just under a half-meter at birth to over two meters at full adulthood. Though comfortable with walking upright, Arcadians are equally at home in water, as evident from the silky smooth texture of their skin. Their supple exterior is thicker than typical humanoid skin and protects them from sudden temperature changes. This hide also contains a unique array of chemical compounds that permits an Arcadian to obtain nourishment through photosynthesis. Arcadian skin tones range from light blue to pale yellow.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to various marine features, Arcadians likewise display distinct mammalian characteristics. In addition to being air-breathers, Arcadians are born alive, and for their first three to six months, live in their mothers marsupial-like pouch. Despite their relative helplessness at birth, however, Arcadian young adapt quite easily to both land and water environments.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Arcadians lack the concepts of the individual or the family unit; the closest approximation is a notion of affiliation with an extended grouping (school) of like-pigmented creatures. All Arcadians seem to share the responsibility for the care and upbringing of their young. Though generally pacifistic, Arcadians have been known to react aggressively to any threat to one of their communal brood. They seem to be devoid of any societal distinctions. All share the work of whatever communal projects are being conducted. As one member of the group quits work, another immediately takes his place for a similar period of time, though how work periods are regulated is presently unknown.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Federation sociologists theorize that the Arcadians as a whole share of form of communal consciousness on a level as yet undetected by normal means. As proof, they cite the amazing speed at which Arcadians assimilate</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">various Federation dialects into their own language without the need for standard translation aids. In addition, despite evidence of relatively advanced technology, the Arcadians have no written language and only a rudimentary oral tradition.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Arcadians enjoy a unique absence of any outward form of government. The closest approximation to a ruling class appears to be a deference toward individuals with a rare form of dorsal spine, though whether this is due to tradition, political prerogatives, or some other convention is unknown.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00ffff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RACIAL HISTORY</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The origins of the Arcadian race remain somewhat puzzling even after six years of almost continuous contact with these sentient beings. Some elements of Arcadian society point to a long-established civilization, while other, equally valid factors suggest that the race became civilized only recently, within the last hundred years or so. Some scientists have postulated that the Arcadians are the remnants of a once-mighty civilization that broke off from their now-extinct parent race. Others believe that the Preservers transplanted the Arcadians from a distant, perhaps now-obliterated planet.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Arcadian culture is centered on mobile, ocean-based landmasses similar to extended city-centers, which suggests a thriving technological society. This notwithstanding, Arcadians are remarkable for their almost total lack of elementary scientific understanding—with the exception of natural and applied physics. In this respect, the Arcadians rival and sometimes exceed accomplishments made by other more mature civilizations.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00ffff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PLACE IN THE FEDERATION</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Though associate members of the Federation, the Arcadians have yet to express any desire to trade with other Federation worlds. At present, only a few Federation sociologists have been allowed on the planet since first contact eight standard years ago. The Arcadians apparently fear that influx of foreign races will cause radical upheaval in their society. For this reason, the Federation Council has placed a temporary contact/trade restriction on the Vellun Gamma system. Thus, although visiting Arcadia is allowed, all would-be tourists must have prior approval from Federation officials.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Arcadians are credited with the first verifiable discovery of proto-matter, the first definable link between energy and matter. Though postulated mathematically for decades, actual proof of the existence of this material remained unproven until the Arcadian scientist Firim’Ja Ale experimentally detected proto-matter existing at a subatomic level in rare forms of antimatter. Initially touted as a potentially limitless energy resource, the basic instability of proto-matter (due to its antimatter properties) soon prompted the Federation Council to ban any manufacture or collection of proto-matter. Though naturally xenophobic to outsiders, the Arcadians have had to alter their isolationism due to Genesis Device publicity. That Dr. David Marcus used proto-matter in the Genesis matrix has catapulted the Arcadian race to public attention. It is hoped that such publicity will prompt the Arcadians to become full-status members of the Federation. Their delegates to the Assembly have been working overtime with Federation scientists to rectify the Genesis experiment disaster, for which they feel to be morally responsible.</P></FONT></BODY>
