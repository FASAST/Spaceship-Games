<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PLANETARY DESCRIPTION</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Edo supports few mountains and many cities, though none seem to be very large. Garden-like jungles dominate the planet, and few large animal species seem to exist. Edo itself is an industrial paradise; an abundance of metals on the surface of the world make manufacturing easy and quick.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00ffff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RACIAL DESCRIPTION</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Edoans are humanoid in appearance with light orange skin. Their most striking feature is their fully manipulative third arm, located in chest area, and their three legs. Their eyes are a darkened yellow that becomes lighter in bright tight. Their bodies seem to lack any noticeable amount of body hair.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most impressive feature of the Edoans is their fantastic skill as artisans. Their tripedal design gives them a much better sense of balance than other beings, and they seem to have a higher dexterity in manipulating objects. This ability allowed them to reach a tool-making level superior to that of the Federation. Today, Edoan tools are considered state-of-the-art Federaton technology.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Edoans have little desire to go into space. With all their vast resources and skills, they prefer privacy to exploration. Those members of the culture with the urge to travel were called "shravs" or the wanderers. Edoan society does not discourage such inclinations. Shravs are considered ‘different’, but are free to follow whatever course they desire, as long as it does not interfere with the privacy of others.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00ffff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RACIAL HISTORY</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Star Fleet discovered the planet Edo relatively early in the history of the Federation, but the admission of the planet to the Federation took many long years.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Initial surveys of the world in Stardate 0/9305 indicated an intelligent humanoid life form and civilization. As reports filtered in from the contact vessel <I>USS Cape Horn, </I>the Federation became anxious to make contact with the Edoans. Although scans showed signs of advanced communications, attempts to contact the leaders of Edo brought no response. Apparently, the Edoans were content to ignore the Federation.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After several long months of communications by voice only, the Edoan government finally granted ambassadors from the Federation the right to meet face to face with the Edoan ruling council, the Regency Prime. The Edoans were more than friendly toward the UFP diplomats, but had no strong interest in joining the Federation. They proved to be a very private people, expressing a strong desire to restrict any contact with the Federation to communication systems only. The Regency Prime agreed to limited trade with the Federation, but contact with Federation members was still going to be kept to a minimum.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Federation Council had more than a passing interest in the Edoans, and wanted Edo admitted to the Federation as soon as possible. However, diplomats could find no way to rush the Regency Prime. The Edoan government meticulously weighed out each option and the outcome of each option before acting. Many Federation ambassadors that met with the Edoans were frustrated by these sorts of delays.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Stardate b/5003, the first of the shravs left to explore this open universe. The Federation saw this as a positive step toward membership, and these first explorers were</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">shuttled about at Star Fleet’s expense. The shravs made frequent reports to the Regency Prime describing the different things they saw and experienced.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, on Stardate 1/8001.01, the Regency Prime voted to join the United Federation of Planets. This decision came as a total surprise to the Federation Department of Interstellar Relations, which had nearly reached the point of considering Edoan admission a lost cause. The people of Edo opened up certain areas of their world to Federation travelers, and more shravs left Edo for Federation universities and colleges, including Star Fleet Academy.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00ffff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PLACE IN THE FEDERATION</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Four Years War exposed Edoans to violence, a distasteful concept in Edoan society. Edo had not experienced warfare in many long centuries, and the conflict with the Klingon Empire discouraged many shravs from careers with Star Fleet. Although they constructed various tools that revolutionized Federatiort technology, Edoans refused to manufacture any sort of weaponry for the war effort. They did supply a great deal of manpower for the war, and many hundreds of Edoans left their cherished privacy to enter the ranks of Star Fleet in this time of need.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Edoans have proven very loyal to the Federation. Indeed, they are considered prime candidates for command positions due to their calmness and loyalty even in the most difficult of situations. The Edoans impressive agility allows them to master the helm or navigation stations of a ship easily, though many prefer to use their skills in the science and engineering areas.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The importance of privacy is one of the Edoan’s fundamental beliefs. They will do almost anything to divert attention from themselves. Unfortunately, their outward appearance does not allow them to blend into a crowd. They rarely speak out publicly against an issue, but will quietly vote against it.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the last 20 years or so, many of these seekers of privacy have left Edo to explore the Federation. Emigration has increased over the past decade at an alarming rate, and it is expected that the Regency Prime may soon limit the number of Edoans who can leave Edo.</P></FONT></BODY>
