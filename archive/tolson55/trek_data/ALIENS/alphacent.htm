<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PLANETARY DESCRIPTION</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Al Rijil is a triple system containing two yellow stars and a red dwarf star. The fourth, fifth, and seventh planet of the system support life. The first two are colonies of Alpha Centauri proper.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alpha Centauri is a lush tropical world that supports a population of 20 billion inhabitants, and ranks as one of the major cultural and scientific centers in the Federation, second only to Terra.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Cochrane Memorial, the Star Fleet Academy, and the Federation Historical Institute will inspire visitors on planet. In addition, this world is known for its huge expanses of unspoiled wilderness, rivaling even the famed Benecian outback.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00ffff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RACIAL DESCRIPTION</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is theorized that Alpha Centaurans are Humans transplanted from Terra’s Mediterranean basin in the fifth century BC (Earth standard date) by the Preservers. They have coarse dark hair, swarthy complexions, and are generally slightly larger than the average human.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alpha Centauran ideals are a cross between Emerson-ian transcendentalism and animistic concepts. From birth, every member of the race learns the <I>Shk-Te Arar, </I>a martial philosophy based on the beliefs that all beings are equal, that moderation should prevail even in circumstances of abundance, and that all things possess a living spirit that is part of a greater whole.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Alpha Centauran concept of equality came about during the slave uprisings that occurred early in the planet’s history. The belief in moderation developed during an early period of warfare between the Alpha Centauran city-states. The last concept stems from the days after the massacre at the nature commune.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alpha Centaurans are conservative and disciplined. They are also aggressive, but not violently so; their philosophy encourages moral superiority over physical force. Nevertheless, Alpha Centaurans love physical sports, especially endurance tests or contests of skill. Some of the best long-distance runners in the Federation are Alpha Centauran. Their sun jamming races, which are steeped in martial philosophy, are almost a religious event among the people.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alpha Centaurans are the most democratic race in all the Federation. They are so democratic, in fact, that they feel superior to other races who only "feign to have the proper moral and social obligations to others". Because of this attitude, most other races label Alpha Centaurans as snobs.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alpha Centaurans believe that an order underlies the universe, no matter how chaotic or confused it might seem, and that each thing has its place—an idea now held mainly by only primitive cultures. In this regard, Alpha Centaurans resemble Vulcans, another people who have held to basic religious and philosophic beliefs despite the passage of time.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alpha Centauran society is classless: everyone is equal. There are, however, some leaders who deal with the Federation when needed, and others who administer internal affairs. Alpha Centaurans understand that not all people can make the proper judgments and decisions needed to run a planet, and thus it is logical to appoint those individuals who are qualified.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alpha Centauran government is run by three elected officials. Everyone on the planet participates in the voting, which is accomplished through an interactive television network. Voting is one of the most important duties of the planet’s citizens, because it shows that they still follow the correct social and moral philosophy. Like sun jamming, voting is considered a religious event.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another interesting facet of Alpha Centauran life is a rite called the <I>Make! Re Talver, </I>or Time of Learning. When an Alpha Centauran child turns b3, he or she may wander about the planet, seeking truth and understanding. During this time, Alpha Centaurans feed and shelter these children, no matter who they are or from where they come. In effect, whatever the seekers want or need is free. Though most other races would take liberties with such a privilege, Alpha Centauran philosophy prohibits the children from abusing it. The children leave the Time of Learning after five years, at which time they must choose their vocation and enter apprenticeship.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alpha Centaurans only resort to physical violence if insulted. The insult they consider most unforgivable is to shake hands. Hand grasping was the ancient Centauran way to begin arm wrestling. By shaking a modern Alpha Centauran’s hand, the other person is saying that he thinks so little of the Centauran that he can defeat him in unarmed combat.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most races find the Alpha Centauran philosophy contradictory. Alpha Centaurans rationalize the discrepancies by saying that one has to be born among them to understand.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00ffff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RACIAL HISTORY</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As there are no written records of Centauran history from before 2,500 years ago, many scholars believe that the Centaurans are an offshoot of the Human race, perhaps seeded on Alpha Centauri by the Preservers. Most Centaurans flatly deny this theory, and some speculate that Humans are, in fact, descended from Centaurans and were transplanted from Alpha Centauri.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prehistoric legend on Alpha Centauri states that their gods led the Centaurans on a great migration from their rocky, inhospitable homeland to a lush green valley. The entire race was awed by this new land and named it Quiberon Prime. This settlement became the dominant city of the culturally homogenous city-states that sprung up on the world. Though each city was self-governing, a senate of representatives from each city-state convened at Quiberon Prime to decide issues ot world-wide importance. As there was plenty of food and land available, there was little strife among the cities.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Eventually, the Centaurans became puzzled by the absence of the gods, and some openly questioned their existence. A small group of philosophers began circulating manuscripts espousing their views on transcendentalism, and soon Centauran society became divided between the pan-theists and the transcendentalists. When the Senate outlawed the teachings of transcendentalism and imprisoned the leaders of the movement, riots broke out. For the first time in Centauran history, each city-state established an army to coerce the others to adopt their beliefs. As the battle lines were drawn, roughly equal numbers of the city-states supported each cause. The Senate disbanded, and the pantheistic cities began to invade territories of the enemy cities. However, the outcome of these wars was indecisive, and the city-states settled into an uneasy cease-fire.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">About a century later, the pantheistic city-states were deteriorating from internal strife and civil disorder. Finally, a massive slave revolt toppled them. (The other city-states,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">true to their beliefs, held no slaves.) The transcendentalists restored order to the devastated pantheistic city-states and reestablished the Senate.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As transcendental belief coalesced, the adolescents began to make journeys of <I>Makel-Re Talvor. </I>A few of them refused to enter into any apprenticeship upon their b8th birthdays and instead established a wilderness community for meditation and communion with nature. Eventually, the commune grew to a few hundred individuals.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Centuries passed, and the Centaurans developed artificial organs and synthetic fibers. However, their technology could not protect them from a comet that crashed on the planet, leveling one city-state and crippling three others. According to Senate proclamation, all were required to help the survivors of the cataclysm, but the Centaurans residing in the nature commune refused to participate. This created strife, and some other Centaurans raided the community, slaying the inhabitants and torching the compound. The vigilantes were subsequently imprisoned, and the transcendentalist philosophy expanded to include toleration of other lifestyles.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alpha Centauri space exploration efforts were second only to those of the Vulcans and the Andorians. Utilizing the solar winds generated by their three suns, they launched space vessels and colonized two other worlds in their system. In Stardate 0/42, a Terran exploration ship entered the Al Rijil system and, much to their surprise, found the advanced civilization of the Centaurans. The Terrans received a warm welcome, however, and the two governments signed a peace accord b 7 years later.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Centaurans boast that their civilization was the driving force behind the creation of the Federation. It was a Centauran who first proposed a political union between Alpha Centauri, Andor, Tellar, Terra, and Vulcan, and it was at Alpha Centauri that representatives from these planets first met to create such a government. In addition, the political treatise establishing the Alpha Centauri Concordium of Planets, consisting of Alpha Centauri, Icarus, and Proxima Centauri, served as the model for the Articles of the Federation.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00ffff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PLACE IN THE FEDERATION</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Centaurans are recognized as the force behind the Star Fleet Advocates Assembly. This powerful group lobbies to ensure that Star Fleet receives enough finances to cover operating expenses, new ship construction costs, and advanced weapons research. They have considerable influence with the Federation Council, but less with the Federation Assembly.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Centauran firms are usually at the forefront of Federation technology. Charlottes Shields, a Centauran firm located in Quiberon Prime, is a major designer and manufacturer of deflector shield systems. Cavanaugh lndustrix of Telperion, Alpha Centauri, is the largest manufacturer of industrial robots in the Federation. In addition, Centauri Spaceworks produces the most cutters and is the only producer of monitors for Star Fleet Command.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alpha Centaurans serve in many positions throughout Star Fleet and the Federation. Because of their views on racial equality, they are excellent diplomats who are able to deftly arbitrate negotiations between other groups because of their ability to see both sides of a situation. This fair mindedness makes them excellent members of the judiciary as well.</P></FONT></BODY>
