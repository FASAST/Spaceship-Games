<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Planetary Description</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Xelata is a warm, tropical planet prone to fierce storms. These storms make life above water extremely difficult for all but the hardiest of life forms, only shrubs, insects, and small amphibians have made their homes above sea level.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As nature was too violent above water, advanced evolution took place only below the water. However, many creatures became too specialized and died out while others reached evolutionary dead ends. Only the Xelata cephalopods, the Terran equivalent of squids and octopi, were adaptable and capable of higher evolution. After millions of <I>years, a </I>species of cephalopod developed <I>an </I>enlarged brain with intelligence and psionic potential. These creatures became known as Xelatians.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00ffff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Racial Description</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Federation first encountered the Xelatians in Stardate 2/1805, when the <I>USS Audacious </I>peacefully met a small, nuclear-powered Xelatian spaceship inside the Tau 56 system. Since then, the Xelatians and the Federation have conducted diplomatic meetings culminating with the appearance of a Xelatian delegation to Terra and Star Fleet Headquarters this year.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much of what we know about the Xelatians was gathered through long and detailed conversations with members of this delegation. They also brought many books and data tapes to help us understand their civilization.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Xelatian physiology is extremely interesting. Their average torso length is about 1.2 meters and they weigh about 100 kilograms. Four meter-long arm tentacles are arranged on each side <I>of </I>the <I>body </I>halfway up <I>the torso. On </I>the lower end of the torso, below four gill slits, are the leg tentacles. There are extremely muscular tentacles to a side, which are used for swimming and capturing large prey in the water.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Near the crown of the torso is a large, oval-shaped eye. Used to the dim lighting of oceans, Xelatians are extremely light-sensitive and see only the cooler, ultraviolet end of the spectrum. What Humanoids consider normal lighting is much too bright for Xelatians, which is why they wear masks. This mask also shines a passive ultraviolet beam through the single eye slit, heightening the Xelatian’s vision and giving off ghostly, pale-blue light.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Communications with the Xelatians must be conducted through universal translators as the Xelatians cannot speak Galacta yet. They communicate among themselves through telepathy and the use of bioluminescent pigmentation on their skin. This ‘speech’ is comparable to an ever-changing intricate mosaic of multicolored lights. Despite this, they have a truly amazing ability to learn languages, and they can now read and write Galacta. They are currently trying to learn to speak through their nasal slits, as their mouth is used for digestion only.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even though the Xelatians’ extensive skeletal framework can support their bodies in high gravities, they have <I>no means of </I>locomotion on land. To overcome this, Xelatians wear a sophisticated anti-gray harness. Over their bodies, they wear a thick robe specially tailored to give a vaguely humanoid appearance. Actually modified environmental suits, these robes are designed to trap moisture close to the Xelatian’s skin. A pump and tank arrangement circulates Xelatian water through special oxygen-permeable sponges inserted into each gill slit so that they can survive out of water. Perched upon the head of each Xelatian is what appears to be a scruffy wig, which </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">is actually Xelatian sea grass. Room air is drawn through the moist clump of vegetation to humidify and scent the otherwise offensive smelling air. On the average, a Xeltian can remain out of his environment for about 7 hours before he must immerse himself in sea water. Xolatians have found Terra’s oceans to be extremely pleasurable.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00ffff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Racial History</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Xelatian history is remarkable for its peacefulness. Throughout their history, there have been only two major incidents of public turmoil.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the roadblocks to Xelatian progress was the development of effective tools in the difficult, buoyant environment. After basic tools were established, complex machinery soon followed, and the Xelatians quickly began to exploit their environment. Great undersea mining operations, huge fission power plants, and the almost nonstop smelting of metals thoroughly polluted the Xelatian environment. Socially, the idea of a communal bond lessened as individuals became enamored with the concept of wealth.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This turmoil brought about what the Xelatians call "The Reclaimatian". Gatherings of the common citizenry turned into riots as pollution levels kept increasing. A few of the egg nurseries had already been contaminated, and the food plants were also suffering. These riots culminated in a mass storming of the major industries. They overwhelmed those running the various facilities and shut Xelatian industry down until industrial leaders found proper means to contain the pollution and took measures to reclaim the damaged areas of the oceans.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After Xelatian industry resumed, emphasis was placed on finding a non-toxic way of producing energy. Unlike most humanoid cultures, the Xelatians discovered the principles of anti-gravity before developing fusion reactors. With this discovery, Xelatian scientist, realized that it was possible for thorn to leave the oceans.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This revelation caused the Xelatians’ second turmoil. A vast majority felt that leaving the oceans would have a detrimental effect on their communal consciousness. They believed that those who left the water would go insane for lack of the communal touch. All research into the use of antigravity for anything but lifting heavy objects was banned. About a hundred years later, when Xelatian scientists developed nuclear power, they realized that they now possessed the ability to leave not only their oceans, but their world as well.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regarding the ban on travel as an intolerable stupidity, a group of scientists secretly began building a small spaceship. When the rest of the community caught onto the scheme, they came en masse to stop the affair, killing many of the scientists protecting the ship. In the confusion, one Xelatian scientist climbed into the ship and blasted off. Though only partially finished, the ship rose above the ocean and moved into the upper reaches of the planet’s atmosphere. However, the ship could not attain orbit, and when it crashed in the waters, the first Xelatian astronaut was near death.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Contrary to his expectations, the dying scientist was hailed as a hero. All the dire predictions about the lessening of the communal consciousness were proven wrong with his voyage. For as he ventured above the oceans, the entire population could feel his excitement at seeing all the things laying beyond the water’s edge. The Xelatians then threw their support behind efforts to explore their world and beyond.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00ffff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Place In the Federation</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Negotiantions to admit the Xelatians to the Federation are proceeding quite well. During their visit to Terra, the Xelatians have shown considerable political savvy and a wry sense of humor that manages to come across the universal translator. The Federation Council has given the Xelatian diplomats the full range of political courtesies possessed by all representatives of members' worlds, including the right to participate in meetings of the Council. The Xelatian delegation has used these privileges to the utmost, attending as many functions as possible, and impressing many with their curiosity and charm.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been one instance when the charm of the Xelatian diplomats failed them. Upon meeting Th’velth, the ambassador from Andor, they appeared quite distraught. After regaining their composure, they apologized profusely to the perturbed ambassador, saying that he greatly resembled a race of aggressive beings who once appeared on Xelata. This bit of news has excited the usually stoic Andorian people. Now, ship after ship in the Blue Fleet is petitioning Galaxy Exploration Command to allow them to explore the Rimward Sector.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Federation is quite eager to admit the Xelatians. Some believe that they would be a welcome addition to the aquatic branch of Star Fleet Marines, while others feel that the Xelatians’ political prowess would make them excellent diplomats. Their appearance would be a definite plus when dealing with non-humanoid races.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps the most important advantage in admitting the Xelatians would be strategic. Gaining the Tau 56 system would give Star Fleet a flanking position on the secretive Tholians. The Xelatians have never encountered the Tholians, but they have lost a few deep-space probes to mysterious circumstances.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However they participate, the Xelatians promise to be a vital addition to the Federation. The Xelatians themselves are extremely eager to "be one with the vast Federation". Their infectious sense of adventure is refreshing to those who have become jaded to the universe’s many wonders.</P></FONT></BODY>
