<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PLANETARY DESCRIPTION</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Althos IV has a wide variety of gemstone deposits that any mining concern in or out of the Federation would kill to develop. Many of the small islands in the seas of Althos IV have gemstone beaches where one can make a fortune by beach combing. Other deposits lie near the underwater volcanoes used by the Bzzit Khaht to generate power for their cities. At this time, the inhabitants are uncertain whether they will permit off planet mining concerns to develop the wealth of their world. As such a temptation is too much for some, a Star Fleet patrol ship has been permanently assigned to the Federation research facility on Althos IV to warn off illegal miners.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00ffff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RACIAL DESCRIPTION</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bzzit Khaht are one of the more unusual members of the UFP. Although Federation scientists on Althos IV have not submitted their final reports, they have released some basic facts concerning this race.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bzzit Khaht are intelligent amphibious reptiles that vaguely resemble some species of the Rendar V Dragon-lizard. Their hearing and sense of smell are exceptional and their skin is covered with sponge-like glands that are used to regulate coordination and respiration while underwater. They seem to spend quite a bit of their time in the water. Their floating, cavern-like enclosures, known as <I>Rauctgus, </I>(or "seatowns"), look very similar to Terran beaver habitats, except for their size. The Bzzit Khaht harnessed the geothermal energies of their planet to power the sea towns, and did so without harming the ecology or geologic stability. The sea beds surrounding these habitats are stocked with a blue moss-like plant called <I>shaka, </I>which is the Bzzit Khaht’s main food supply. Some of the larger <I>shaka </I>planting circles have a diameter of 70 kilometers and are easily discernible from orbit.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bzzit Khaht society is divided into three segments. The most common of these is the <I>Bzzgaht, </I>or "Gatherers". The <I>Bzzgaht </I>tend the sea towns and underwater fields ot <I>shaka, </I>and construct new settlements when they ‘feel’ that expansion is necessary. These psionic feelings seem to be possessed by every one of the Bzzit Khaht.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second division of the Bzzit Khaht is the <I>Bzzmaht, </I>or "Routers", who oversee <I>Bzzgaht </I>parties while they carry out an assignment. A <I>Bzzgaht </I>does not get promoted to <I>Bzzmaht </I>they seem to be born into their position. No physiological differences between the two are apparent. There seems to be approximately one <I>Bzzmaht </I>born for every 20 or so <I>Bzzgaht.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third and final division of Bzzit Khaht society is the <I>Bzzbaht, </I>or "providers", the leaders and progenitors of their race. They appear somewhat larger than either the <I>Bzzgaht </I>or <I>Bzzmaht, </I>and each sea town usually has between two and four of them. The providers’ main duty is to bear and raise the young of all three social divisions. The <I>Bzzbaht </I>also are considered the theoretical leaders of their various sea towns (it is very difficult to explain the word "leader" to the Bzzit Khaht), and they are usually the ones that deal with off worlders.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are three divisions of Bzzit Khaht society, but they are not classes in the usual sense. Every individual is equal in Bzzit Khaht society, which is divided only to increase efficiency. The Bzzit Khaht are a cooperative unity without strife or disagreement. They have no government structure because every individual is in complete agreement with every other individual. Working for the betterment of their race is their personal goal as well as their communal</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">goal. It is not that every individual knows the thought of every other; rather, every individual knows the desires and need of every other individual. Legend tells of a sea town that was demolished by a tidal wave, and within hours, every other sea town had dispatched aid to the area without knowing of the disaster. The people simply knew that a need had to be filled there. As his psionic ability does not transfer well to other races, the Bzzit Khaht cannot really be termed empathic.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bzzit Khaht are fairly sophisticated medical scientists, having eliminated most of the bacteriological hazards that once plagued the swamps and shallow seas of Althos IV. Although still brief by Terran standards, the Bzzit Khaht now live 30 to 40 standard years, whereas a few centuries ago, they could expect to live less than 20 years.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00ffff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RACIAL HISTORY</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The road to intelligence for the Bzzit Khaht is presently unclear. References to the Gironapir, or "Awakening", are common in Bzzit Khaht language and history. Apparently, thousands of years ago, the Bzzit Khaht (who were then simply amphibians swimming in the seas of Althos IV) became aware of each other through some sort of psionic jolt. They began to communicate and work together to develop a new society, and have continued this process ever since.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before contact with the Federation, the Bzzit Khaht had developed a fairly technical society on their own. They had sent chemically powered spaceships throughout their entire system and were in the process of setting up permanent space platforms in orbit about Althos IV and the gas giant Althos V. They also had begun to mine the gases out of Althos V for use as rocket fuel. Amazingly, they had achieved all this without discovering atomic fission, although they did understand the theoretical principles involved. When asked about this curiosity, <I>Bzzbaht </I>say that nuclear power just wasn’t "right" for the Bzzit Khaht society.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On Stardate 211005.09, the survey vessel <I>USS </I>Chaffee discovered the Bzzit Khaht, and they received full member status five years later.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00ffff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PLACE IN THE FEDERATION</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Federation still has much to learn about the Bzzit Khaht. A research station has been set up on Althos IV with the permission of the Bzzit Khaht, who have just recently begun sending envoys to various Federation worlds. Although their mouths can just about handle speaking Galacta, the gurgling and hissing is sure to irritate listeners. Therefore, Bzzit diplomatic Khaht expeditions travel with a number of experienced linguists, sociologists, and universal translators.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Being water creatures, the Bzzit Khaht need special accommodations while off planet. Their skin needs a good soaking at least once a day or else serious chaffing, discomfort, and even dehydration will result. The sponge-like hydrous membranes on the skin of the Bzzit Khaht release a stink that most races find very offensive. However, Federation scientists have developed a special aerosol deodorant that the Bzzit Khaht can spray on when attending interracial affairs. This product seems to have made a hit with the Bzzit Khaht, who have sent the formula back to Althos IV so that they can begin mass production.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How the relationship between the Bzzit Khaht and the Federation will develop is still unclear. The Bzzit Khaht make exceptionally accurate acoustic systems, rivaling those from planets with more advanced technology. With a population of over ten million inhabitants all bent on the same goals and ideals, it is certain that their race can develop much faster than the usual races of bickering, opinionated individuals.</P></FONT></BODY>
