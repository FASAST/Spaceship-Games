<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">VULCAN CEREMONIAL ATTIRE</P>
</font></B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Terrans have always been extremely interested in the Vulcan people. Now, with the appearance of many Vulcan delegates on Terra, interest in Vulcan culture is at a high peak. The first part of this essay describes the general appearance of Vulcans ceremonial attire, called the Tlor <I>Thaka!, </I>and touches upon its history. The essay then reflects on how a Vulcan diplomat dresses may reveal his politics and his standing in the rumored crisis affecting the Vulcan people.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The basic components of the <I>Tlor Thakal </I>vary little from person to person. They include a hat, shirt, vest, pants (a long skirt for females), boots, and a hip-long robe. Every Vulcan possesses a <I>Tior Thakal </I>for use when participating in important gatherings or rituals. The formality of most Federation Council and Assembly meetings requires Vulcan diplomats to wear their <I>Tior Thakals, </I>for example.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The history behind the <I>Tior Thakal </I>provides important insight into Vulcan motivation. Early in Vulcan’s violent history, the position of messsenger was despised. The messenger’s job was to run back and forth across battlefields, delivering his warlord’s threats and insults to enemy warlords. Those regularly chosen for the job were the mentally handicapped and those who did not wish to fight. In the eyes of Vulcan warriors, to not fight was to blaspheme the gods; pacifistic creatures were lower than the lowest animal in a dung heap.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This animosity toward messengers often caused their deaths, both on and off the battlefield. To safegaurd his messengers and to satisfy his rather sick humor, one warlord made all his messengers dress in costumes designed by his fools. The costume was called "the Uniform of Deep Thinkers", the <I>Tior Thakal. </I>Although the messengers were no longer mistaken for the enemy, they now suffered beneath the weight of the robes and Vulcan’s oppressive heat.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When Surak ventured across the sands to negotiate peace, he did so in a Tlor <I>Thakal. </I>Physically strong, he wore the heavy robes with such dignity that those who saw him could never again consider the <I>Tior Thakal </I>to be a costume of fools. Surak chose to wear the robes out of respect for the messengers, calling them the real Vulcans. He also extolled the <I>Tior Thakal </I>as a way to ignore the body and concentrate on the mind. Whenever Vulcans don the <I>Tior Thakal, </I>they remind themselves of Surak’s life and his devotion to logic.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While remaining true to the spirit of the original, the <I>Tior Thakal </I>has changed to suit the more appearance-conscious world of interstellar diplomacy. One noticeable change is the use of a wider range of colors. Besides the traditional black and gray, some Vulcans now wear blue, purple, and light gold robes.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fabrics have also changed. Very seldom are the robes woven from the spines of Crying Plants as they once were. Vulcans are artistic weavers, and they use fabrics such as Hesperian Wool and Talfarra Gem Weave to great effect. Recently, some Vulcan diplomats have had quotes from Vulcan philosophy embroidered down the vest of their <I>Tior Thakats </I>and other formal robes.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jewelry is another aspect of the Vulcan diplomat’s appearance. Placed upon the brim of their headpiece is a <I>To/c Vu! </I>("Home Stone"), a gem or crystal common to the region where the wearer was born, It is treated with great respect.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Vulcan artistry in metals is considerable, and the belt of the <I>Tlor Thakal </I>displays some of the finest examples of this skill. Fashioned from precious metals such as gold,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">silver, or odrazinc, the belt sports a wide buckle with an intricately sculptured geometric design or version of the family name.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Vulcans place little emphasis on rank and will never brag about their importance. Nevertheless, Vulcan society has found it necessary to be able to distinguish those in important positions from the rest of the populace. These dignitaries wear a <I>Kelca Shev, </I>or "Badge of Position", which usually takes the form of a large pendant or embroidered design worn upon the chest. The design of the badge is usually a symbolic representation of the wearer’s occupation or his name in stylized letters. Many Vulcans who wear the <I>Kelca Shev </I>find it a great imposition on their privacy. They wear their badges only during official functions or when seeking favors from someone.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people are familiar with the IDIC, the pendant representing the Vulcan concept of Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations. Related to the IDIC, but more personal, is the <I>Sosona-nome, </I>a necklace consisting of a subtle arrangement of stones, precious metals, and sculpted symbols. It apparently carries more importance to the wearer than the IDIC. The word <I>Nome </I>in Vulcan means "All". In their philosophy, the word encompasses the various ideas about how beings perceive the universe.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some believe that the pieces in the necklace can be rearranged or completely altered to suit the wearer. If this is true, then the <I>Sosona-nome </I>may be an attempt to express the wearer’s personal vision of existence in metal. Certain pieces in the large necklace are recognizable as small <I>Teic Vu! </I>stones, <I>Telca She vas, </I>and words or phrases from Vulcan thought. All Vulcans probably have a <I>Sosona-nome, </I>given to them just after their <I>Kahs-wan, </I>the test of an adolescent’s maturity. Although <I>Sosona-nomes </I>are worn only at private ceremonies marking births and deaths, Ambassador Sarek has been seen wearing his in public. He has apparently caused the Vulcan equivalent of a scandal in doing so.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If it is true that what a Vulcan wears is a personal choice, then what can be learned from a Vulcan’s choice of clothing? Some believe those relations between Vulcan and her colonies are steadily deteriorating. Delegates from the Vulcan colonies have been wearing relatively flamboyant <I>for Thakals, </I>while diplomats from Vulcan appear in dark, somber robes. Perhaps the Vulcan colonials are expressing their difference from Vulcan by their choice of clothing.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Others say that there is a Vulcan crisis stemming from their involvement in the Federation. Perhaps the destruction of the Vulcan-crewed <I>USS Intrepid </I>some 25 years ago created the sentiment that Vulcan is too involved in the Federation. This might explain why some Vulcan diplomats have shunned contact with other races outside scheduled meetings. If Federation involvement were indeed the bone of contention, this Vulcan controversy would resemble the issues raised by the old Terran Return League.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Still other Vulcan specialists have asserted that the aforementioned concerns are but symptoms of a single, deeper issue. They say that the real issue dividing the Vulcan people is whether or not the Vulcan people are losing their identity. Vulcans are becoming concerned about the marked lessening of what were once strict rules of conduct. Vulcans born and raised in the company of other races are exhibiting shocking behavior, which could be seen as a sign of the resurgence of emotionalism. If today’s Vulcan adolescents sometimes laugh, what of tomorrow’s children? Will future Vulcans rediscover the attractions of passion, or of violence? These questions are vitally important to Vulcans.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A great deal of this debate centers on Ambassador Sarek and his family. His marriage and his son both might be seen as challenges to Vulcan society. Sarek’s life has been well publicized, and such attention, though unsought, may be seen as a further insult to the Vulcan way. His opinions on the Federation have long been known, and his papers are required reading for those looking for the spirit behind the Federation. His famous speech at the Babel conference made him a respected leader of planetary sovereignty. He has also championed the cause of the Vulcan colonies in their dealings with Vulcan. Abandoning his <I>Tior Thakal </I>for longer robes, Sarek also wears his <I>Sosona-nome </I>in public. All these factors together seem to make Ambassador Sarek the target of disapproval by any Vulcan feeling his culture threatened. It is curious to note that younger Vulcans have begun to wear long robes, apparently following Ambassador Sarek’s lead.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As noted before, the Vulcan people have been long admired for their ability to retain their composure and sense of logic. Whatever the cause for their internal troubles, they will no doubt resolve it without any public discord. This means that we are left to scrutinize the apparel of Vulcan diplomats to discern what is going on in Vulcan society.</P></FONT></BODY>
