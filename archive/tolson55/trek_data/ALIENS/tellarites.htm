<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PLANETARY DESCRIPTION</P>
</font></B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tellar is a warm, terrestrial world about half the size of Terra. It has few mountain ranges and deserts, as most of the land is covered with either swamps or plains. Though 50 percent of Tellar’s surface is covered with water, there are only two medium-sized oceans. The majority of the water is contained in the numerous fresh-water lakes and streams</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00ffff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RACIAL DESCRIPTION</P>
</font></B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The inhabitants of Tellar seem to have acquired an unspoken stigma from other worlds in the Federation. Such phrases as "stubborn as a Tellarite" <I>or "pig-snouted argu</I>menter" have often been used to describe Tellar’s inhabitants. However, those who look beyond the surface aspects of the Tellarite race have found that they possess noble and praiseworthy <I>attributes.</i></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Being argumentative is natural to a Tellarite, and they cannot understand why other intelligent races do not enjoy it as much as they do. Other races take offense while arguing with Tellarites because Tellarites are adept at finding the weak point in their opponents’ arguments, thus showing that their point of view is the soundest.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tellarites are very honorable beings, but few can appreciate their honor. This honor stems from a respect for truth, but only a truth that can be defended in open debate. A Tellarite believes that truth is on the side of the being who argues his point better. A Tellarite will always carry out his promises, but he must be nailed down on every detail, as Tellarites have a talent for finding loopholes in almost every agreement. Outright deceit is one of the few taboos in Tellarite society. Although Tellarites never lie, they only tell their own form of the truth.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tellarite scientific endeavors are performed with a dedication few other races can match. This dedication sometimes borders on the obsessive—some Tellarite scientists have been known to immolate themselves after a particularly disappointing failure. Although not understood by other races of the Federation, this attitude has helped the Tellarite race to expand the limits of Federation knowledge.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even today, few outsiders know much about Tellarite society. Family groups are rarely seen in public, females and children are normally kept secluded in Family Compounds. Only rarely do Tellarite workers and merchants permit their family members to leave <I>their home </I>planet and accompany them into space. The public presence of a high-ranking Tellarite diplomat and his family is usually worthy of Federation Infonet coverage, and even then, only brief glimpses of the entourage <I>are seen. Armed </I>family retainers make no bones about keeping idle curiosity seekers at a distance. The Tellarite’s protectiveness of his females and young seems to stem from some unusually strong ancestral urge to keep all predators away from the herd. As Tellarite society opens up to contact with other Federation races, this instinctive behavior may lessen.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00ffff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RACIAL HISTORY</P>
</font></B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tellarites descended from herd animals that roamed the wide, expansive, sun-baked plains of Tellar. The scarcity of water and food forced these bipedal, omnivorous beings to develop cunning ways of survival, which eventually evolved into real intelligence. Over the millennia, the leader of the Tellarites often had to defend his position not by trial of strength (as with most herd animals), but by the expression of his intellect through debate. Known to last for</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">several days, tests of intelligence ended when one participant accepted his opponents’ reasoning, thereby allowing the herd to follow the victor.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tellarites achieved a unified planetary government at about the time of the first Terran-Alpha Centauran contact. As they prefer to argue out their differences, Tellarites have experienced few wars. Only rarely do they come to blows, and murder is almost unknown on Tellar. Modern medicine and treatment usually cures those mentally disturbed inhabitants who have ever killed another Tellarite in anger. When treatment fails, Tellarites are usually sent to some offplanet institution, such as the Tellarite Mental Health Complex orbiting Gavoc VII, the penal colony on Tantalus V, and the asylum on Elba II.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00ffff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PLACE IN THE FEDERATION</P>
</font></B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ruling Mothers of Tellar encourage the race to devote themselves to productive pursuits. Tellarite firms that construct life support systems are very prosperous, as Tellardesigned components are typically more reliable and easier to operate than other manufacturers’ units. Tellarite development of ato-elemental microcircuitry, which is tough enough to be installed in warp engines, has made Tellar the leader in engineering control mechanisms throughout the Federation. Tellarite corporations manufactured most of the control circuitry in Terra’s newly constructed Space Dock. Tellarite research into tissue regeneration and microlaser surgery has revolutionized Federation medicine over the past few years. The Ggramphud Histo-Cryogenics Corporation is the Federation’s leader in the field of cryothermic (super-cold) medical treatment. Through their research, Tellarite doctors and scientists have made many drug therapy treatments obsolete, and cryothermic treatment is safer and more effective than many drugs used at Federation medical facilities.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tellarites have settled over 50 worlds, mostly since they joined the Federation. These colonies appear to be governed by a system mirroring the one on Tellar.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most of the worlds settled by Tellarites have few other Federation races on them, though the larger trading center planets have high numbers of non-Tellarites. Nearly 100 other Federation worlds have a Tellarite settlement on them. Most Tellarites fear that too much contact with outsiders will disintegrate their social structure, yet value the ideas and technology offered by those outsiders. This dilemma has been the Tellarite’s most popular subject for argument during the last 50 years. Membership in the Federation has advanced Tellarite knowledge, but has also introduced <I>'dangerous' concepts, such as equality of the sexes.</i></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been dissent among some Tellarite factions within the government concerning their future in the Federation. Some extremists have even begun splinter cultures of their own, ignoring the existence of the Federation entirely, and settling on distant planets, where they engage in smuggling, piracy, colonial raiding, and unlicensed mining against non-Tellarites, of course. The Ruling Mothers of Tellar have tried in vain to come to terms with these renegades, and the Tellarites will not allow other races to interfere with what they consider to be an internal problem. The acts of these splinter groups have increased tension between the Tellarite and Federation governments, and it is only a matter of time before Star Fleet steps in to halt these illegal operations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Throughout the Federation, Tellarite participation is increasing. In addition to starships fully crewed by Tellarite personnel, Star Fleet has begun to integrate Tellarites into multi-racial crews on some of the finest research vessels and military starships. Their instinct for familial protection is decreasing to the point where some Tellarite females may soon begin training for various duties away from their family compounds and enclaves, perhaps even with Star Fleet itself. The general opinion in Tellarite society is that change is, indeed, inevitable. Although some Tellarites wish that they had never joined the Federation, most realize that secession from the Federation would inevitably mean the destruction of Tellarite society. Without the unity and the protection of the Federation behind it, the Tellarite sphere of influence would soon be overrun by independents, with no respect for the rights of Tellarites. There is little doubt that the Tellarites will continue to be a dependable and efficient member of the Federation, contributing more than most to its development. In fact, some Tellarites are as proud of the Federation as they are of their own home world.</P>
