<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PLANETARY DESCRIPTION</P>
</font></B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Andor is a comparatively high-G world, gravity being 17 percent over the Terran 1G. Additionally, the planet’s atmosphere is thinner than the atmosphere of Earth, usually 590 mm of mercury, compared to the Terran normal of 760 mm at sea level. Thus, Andorians have much better lung capacity than the typical Human, and can work and fight more efficiently in thin atmosphere.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00ffff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RACIAL DESCRIPTION</P>
</font></B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The blue skin, pure white hair, and prominent antennae of the Andorians are well-known throughout the Federation. Their blue hue is the result of a high concentration of cobalt in the hemoglobin of their red corpuscles. The antennae are remarkably sensitive sensory organs, giving the Andorians sonar detection abilities similar to those of Terran bats. Because of these organs, it is very difficult to sneak up on or to elude an Andorian—even in total darkness. A less desirable characteristic of the Andorian antennae is their sensitivity to pain. Being hit in the antennae gives the Andorian as much pain similar to a Human male struck in the groin. Andorians in Star Fleet are normally issued extra protection for their antennae, and Andorian marine personnel wear specially designed combat helmets. Though allowing the antennae to protrude through the top, the helmet offers them as much armor protection as the rest of the head.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a rule, Andorians are stronger and hardier than most races except Vulcans. This is a result of Andor’s greater gravity, harsher climate, and thin air.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Few attributes of the race have caused more misunderstanding than the famed Andorian temper. This is because Andorians usually exhibit tempers only when temperatures are soaring. Normally, Andorians are cool, logical thinkers who act only when logic deems it rational to do so. However, it is easy to overlook the depth of emotion that an Andorian not only feels but can also express. It is a mistake to think of an Andorian as a blue-skinned Vulcan. Even at cool temperatures, it is possible to rile an Andorian so much that he abandons his logic for his more violent roots.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although Andorians are stoic and largely unsentimental, they do respect and revere family ties. To insult an Andorian’s clan is to insult him and his entire race. Those who do so, either deliberately or inadvertently, will discover just how dangerously crafty an Andorian can be.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Andorian clan relationships and the tendency of clans to specialize in one profession are very similar to Gorn practices. Perhaps this is why almost half the negotiation team at the Clanhaven conference between the Federation and the Gorn Alliance are Andorians. The most prestigious Andorian clan is the Clan of Combat, which handles nearly all the military operations of Andor, including ship construction and arms shipments. The Controllers Clan, another influential clan, is responsible for controlling the weather on Andor, Andorian colony worlds, and other customers.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00ffff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RACIAL HISTORY</P>
</font></B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Andorians are believed to have originated in the glaciers and ice fields of the southern polar continent on Andor. Because they developed in cold climes, the Andorians are endothermic to a degree and have trouble keeping their body temperatures at 57° C. when in temperatures of 44° C. and higher. Exposure to higher temperatures affects the Andorians’ minds, causing them to lose their logical thought processes and, instead, become cunningly violent.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was the migration of early Andorian tribal clans into the more temperate northern latitudes that caused the race to become violently emotional—yet efficient—warriors. In the warmer northern regions of the planet, the Andorians found an abundance of food and learned the rudiments of agriculture. However, as the summer heat affected them, the clans became more warlike and fought each other for land and food, even though there was plenty for all. Hungry for war, the northern tribes moved south to fight those tribes in the polar region. Fortunately, the cooler climates curbed the violent tendencies of the Andorian invaders, allowing both sides to work out logical solutions to their differences.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To defend against the inevitable invasions from the north, the Andorians in the polar regions founded Cities of Refuge. In these cities, hotheads who had murdered someone could seek protection from avenging relatives— provided he joined the city’s defense force for the next ten years. The Cities of Refuge protected the southern Andorians, and allowed them to develop advanced technology. Their first project was to reduce the variability in their own climate and thus diminish the tendency of cool-headed Andorians to become violent ‘hotheads’. (It is interesting to note that the terms "cooler heads" and "hotheads", used so much in discussing Andorians, were actually the direct translations of Andorian terms.) Their <I>success </I>at climate control provided the impetus to unite the various tithes under one rule.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Andorians are one of the few races to have developed warp drive on their own. Before they <I>encountered </I>the Humans, they had established the Andorian Star Clan, an interstellar empire consisting of 13 planets. First contact with Humans did not proceed well, and ended with the Andorians opening fire on the Terran exploratory vessel. Luckily, before the Terran alliance could gear up for war with the Andorian Star Clan, Andor received a Vulcan peace mission. As the Andorians are themselves creatures of logic, the Vulcans were well received. The ensuing talks averted war between Andor and Terra, and Andor joined the Terran alliance, a logical move in the best interests of all concerned. (Her former subject worlds became Andorian protectorates.) When the Articles of Federation were signed at the first Babel Conference, Andor was one of the five original signatories.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00ffff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PLACE IN THE FEDERATION</P>
</font></B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the Andorians have matured as a race, the martial spirit is still very strong throughout their culture. Extremely disciplined and possessing a strong sense of duty and honor, Andorians make excellent military officers. In fact, high proportions of all Federation military personnel (including officers of top rank) are Andorian. Andorians served diligently during both the Romulan War and the Four Years War, distinguishing themselves with their sacrifice and devotion to duty. More medals for distinguished service during wartime have been awarded to Andorians than to any other Federation race. Sadly, not a few of those were awarded posthumously. One of the two combat decorations unique to the Star Fleet Marines, the Heart of S’em-loh, was named after an Andorian who was the first Star Fleet Marine <I>ever killed </I>in action.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to its place in Federation military history, Andor is renowned for its achievements in weather control. Andorians were the first race to develop climate control on a planet-wide scale, and all their colony worlds are either frigid ice-balls or climate-controlled planets. Whenever a world’s leaders wish to control their weather, they usually call in Andorian experts.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the greatest smears to Andorian honor is the existence of the Warriors of Andor. The Warriors are an anti-Federation terrorist group that developed from an Andorlan clan that refused to accept Andor’s ‘surrender’ to the Terran alliance and, later, the Federation. The Warriors became outlaws, working to bring down Andor’s ruling clan and to dissolve Andorian ties to the Federation. After an unsuccessful coup, Andorian authorities captured most of the Warriors, but some managed to escape off planet. In the years since, these renegade Andorians have organized and maintained one of the bloodiest terrorist outfits operating in Federation space. Known as the Warriors of Andor (to the disgust of all honorable Andorians) the terrorists conduct numerous bombings, assassinations, and kidnappings throughout the Federation annually. Star Fleet Intelligence considers the <I>Warriors of </I>Andor <I>to </I>be <I>among their top ten </I>public enemies, and has conducted several missions to discover the whereabouts of these terrorists. However, if the Andorian Clan of Combat manages to locate the Warriors first, it is certain that the terrorists will never make it to trial.</P></FONT></BODY>
