<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PLANETARY DESCRIPTION</P>
</font></B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Slightly smaller than the average Class M planet, Cait is a warm, tropical world of thick, lush jungle, sunny, grassy plains, and wide, sandy beaches. Its thick atmosphere is perfumed with the scent of the dense jungle. Though hot and sunny, frequent breezes sweep its shores and plains. The planet’s climate is inviting to most life forms, and Cait has become a popular tourist stop (except during its short rainy season). The abundance and variety of plant and animal life have kept Caitian zoologists and botanists busy for centuries and off planet scientists find Caitian ecology a complex and fascinating topic.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00ffff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RACIAL DESCRIPTION</P>
</font></B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Caitians are upright, bipedal beings with manipulative hands, who are descended from a felinoid life form. Their feline ancestry shows in their facial structure, the fur covering their bodies, and their voices, which resemble the purring of Terran felines.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Caitians stand two to three meters tall, slightly larger than the average humanoid. However, they are more agile and dexterous than their size would suggest. Having evolved on a hospitable world, they are not as hardy as many other life forms, and thus susceptible to many diseases on other planets. Fortunately, Caitian medicine is advanced enough to cope with many of the virological problems resulting from interplanetary travel.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Caitians are primarily noted for their loyalty. Their society is centered around large clans, and clan members are related by a set of connections that are basic knowledge for a Caitian and a hopeless, incomprehensible tangle for anyone else. To a Caitian, clans are an extension of self, and they depend on their members as much as their members depend on their right arms. Clan members treat members of other clans (and other races) as important beings with equal claim to their world and its resources, but do not rely on them as much as they do on their clan.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unlike many other clan-oriented cultures, Caitian clans do not specialize in separate areas. They encourage wide diversity within the clan so that whenever a clan member needs a service or item, someone in the clan can help him. Different fields and businesses contain members of as many different clans as possible so that no one clan has control of that field.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Caitians practice monogamous, lifelong marriages. A couple usually has two or three <I>brre’I </I>("litters") of up to four children. Children of the same <I>brre’I, </I>known as <I>brrel’mar, </I>are exceptionally close, and the clan usually separates them in schooling and activities, which prevents them from developing a disproportionate dependence on each other. Each clan member shares the responsibility of child rearing.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Caitians do not differentiate between sexes in activities or social standing, striving to be egalitarian in every respect. They provide the elderly with special treatment, but do not consider this any more than a tribute to their elders’ wisdom and experience. As the saying has it, "Old age is a power all may achieve."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because Caitians inhabit a planet where the living is easy, they can set aside concerns about survival and concentrate on the finer things in life. Their culture has a deep appreciation for beauty, which is expressed in many ways: study and contemplation of nature, producing works of art that mirror nature, and, most commonly, surrounding themselves with by beauty and comfort.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some clans practice monastic, contemplative approaches to life, preferring the detailed appreciation of one flower to the overwhelming profusion of an entire jungle. However, most Caitians express their love of life and beauty by surrounding themselves with abundance. A comfortable, beautiful home is the desire of every Caitian. Home is the center of Caitian life, and a sign of acceptance by a Caitian is being invited to his house. Despite the large numbers of tourists who visit Cait, few have seen the inside of a Caitian house. Caitians are very territorial, and they react aggressively against any threats to their homes. Their cities are notably clean and well kept, as the fastidious Caitians cannot abide a damaged environment.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although Caitians are slow to anger, they are fierce when enraged, and they have been known to hold grudges for generations. They do not like being angry because it is not a beautiful state, and the idea of war is unspeakably ugly to them. While they shun physical violence, they are capable of devious psychological games.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Caitians are so interested in nature, and each other, their science has long emphasized planetary and medical sciences. They had not yet developed space travel when discovered by the Federation, as they had not "gotten around to it". Although some studied astronomy, Caitians consider the near at hand to have more interest.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Caitians are intrigued by the variety of life forms in the universe, and wish to study them all. Although their race has little psionic potential, they are particularly interested in the practice of psionics, as they never dreamed of such a thing.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Though interested in other life forms, Gaitians are more interested in themselves, or (as they put it) in each other. Some races think that the Caitians look down on them, but Caitians are quick to state that they regard all races as equal. For their part, Caitians often feel that other races, particularly Humans, are patronizing toward them. As they find Caitians particularly attractive, Humans may be guilty of this, but not consciously.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00ffff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RACIAL HISTORY</P>
</font></B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The lush jungles of Gait have produced a fascinating array of plant and animal life. As the feline ancestors of the Caitians evolved into an upright, intelligent species, they moved toward the clearings and beaches on the fringes of the jungle.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As these predators moved out of the jungle, they turned to the waters for food. Caitian civilization first developed as a fishing, seafaring race, clustered in settlements along the shore. However, they soon discovered that agriculture appealed to them more than the strenuous fishing life, and sailors became only figures of a semi-legendary past.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Caitians have few class distinctions (though they say that they have none.) One clan, the Vr’aun, are considered the rulers. The eldest member of the Vr’aun rules as <I>Agra’nn </I>(translated as either "King" or "Chairman") for three years, then passes the rule to the next eldest. In this system, the rulers have lived as regular working members of the society before taking office, and are respected for their experience and knowledge. The Caitians adore pomp and ritual, and enjoy having a coronation every three years. Retired <I>Agra’nn </I>are still highly respected members of the society, and reside in the <I>L’Iura, </I>a combination palace-and-library, where Caitians may consult them on any social or philosophical questions.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because of their society and sexual equality, and also because they are the only intelligent species on their planet, the Caitians have had no experience with prejudice and discrimination. Pleased with the variety of sapient beings in the universe, they treat all with respect until a race proves itself unworthy of such regard.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no history of organized warfare on Cait. As the planet is small and the Caitian population homogeneous, no cultural schisms have occurred. Nevertheless, there have been feuds between clans. Violence in these cases mostly takes the form of kidnapping, arson, and sabotage, as the Caitians have not developed weapons technology.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Caitians were delighted and overwhelmed when the Federation ship <I>USS Framingham </I>contacted them. Excited though not surprised of the existence of others in the universe, they were eager to become part of the Federation. Cait was admitted to the Federation quicker than any other planet with a native, sapient life form.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00ffff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PLACE IN THE FEDERATION</P>
</font></B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Caitians are often torn between their desire to explore the universe and their strong ties with home. Few Caitians have been willing to spend time away from home to serve the Federation, either as civilians or in Star Fleet. However, as more Caitians leave home, more will be willing to follow, knowing that there are friendly furry faces out there. The number of Caitians scattered through the galaxy is expected to increase exponentially in the coming years.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Few Caitians choose to join Star Fleet, due to their pacifistic natures, but those who do usually serve in noncombat roles, such as the medical branch or communications. Caitians are prized members of Star Fleet, as they transfer their tenacious loyalty to their officers and fellow crewmembers.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Only a handful of Caitians can be found in Star Fleet Marines or the Security branch, as the violent activity of these positions is too much for Caitians to stomach. Starship combat is sufficiently abstract for them to handle, however, and some enjoy the sight of beams and missiles cutting though the darkness of space. These Gaitians force themselves to ignore the unbeautiful results of a successful shot.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Caitian civilians serve the Federation mostly as scientists, as they have no patience with working in the bureaucracy. Many Caitians travel the galaxy as independent scholars, and some as traders. These often travel in starships packed with as many clan members as wish to come along, in an effort to ward off homesickness for the jungles <I>and </I>beautiful houses of Cait.</P></FONT></BODY>
