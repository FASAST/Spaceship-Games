<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PLANETARY DESCRIPTION</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The planet Zaran possesses an odd contrast of environments. Its deep sea beds remain frozen except during the summer months, when some surface ice does melt. Rising far above the seas are the desert-like plateaus and buttes where Zaranite civilization is centered.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is little plant and animal life on the world, but there are wondrous species nonetheless. Most of the dominant species are reptilian. Giant winged lizards called <I>Raldos </I>nest in the cliffs of the plateaus, and <I>Volpas, </I>or sand snakes, move like sharks under the sands of the vast deserts.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The seas are dark, as the high plateaus prevent sunlight from reaching them. Little lives in the frozen blackness, and only a few mammals are known to tunnel in the glacial seas. Chemicals from within the planet have contaminated several of these seas, further discouraging life from evolving there.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many off worlders find it difficult to deal with Zaran’s thin air. The Federation embassy on Zaran is usually staffed by races accustomed to thin atmospheres, but those who are not acclimated consider duty in the Zaran Embassy as some sort of punishment.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00ffff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RACIAL DESCRIPTION</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The<I> </I>Zaranites are a very militaristic <I>and </I>ritual-observing people. In their first encounter with the Federation, they attacked first, and when they discovered that they could not win, they surrendered. Such is the way that they have dealt with life on their planet.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most individuals see Zaranites only when they are masked and protected. They have dark skin with long, stringy black hair, deep-set eyes, and narrow fingers. When out of their native environment, they wear a fully protective suit that covers their narrow bodies and provides them with filtering system to breathe air. The suit also holds in several of the rare Beega insects from Zaran. These insects inhabit the surface of the Zaranite’s skin, often attaching themselves to nerve endings. Once there, they dissipate stress and cause pleasant feeling of relaxation. Unfortunately, the insects area killed when removed from the thin atmosphere on Zaran; thus, the suit is worn to keep them alive. Virtually every Zaranite family raises Beega insects, which can fetch handsome prices on some Federation worlds.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The languages used on Zaran are difficult for even the best Federation scholars to master. Each family seems to use their own variant of the base language, Zaraneese. It takes skilled use of a universal translator to make out all the forms of the Zaranite languages. This linguistic complexity has helped Zaranite society remain a mystery to most Federation members, and the Zaranites are more than happy to keep it that way.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Zaranite tradition is linked deeply with a series of books called the <I>Casaval, </I>which deal with the rituals of life and progressive aging of the Zaranite race. These rituals begin with violent, aggressive activity and finish with calm passivity. The purpose of these rituals is to attempt to reach the stars, paralleling the Romulan Road to the Stars in some respects. Scholars who have looked into the <I>Casaval </I>have found it to be long and difficult to understand. It is very rare to find a Zaranite who is not carrying one of the 13 volumes of the <I>CasavaL</P>
</I></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00ffff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RACIAL HISTORY</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First contact with the Zaranites came on Stardate 1/9302.23, when the Galaxy Exploration Command vessel <I>USS Clandre </I>entered the Byrdica system and discovered a Zaranite vessel in orbit around Zaran II. Subsequently, the Zaranites ordered the <I>Clandre </I>to surrender. Captain Jerry Harvardson of the <I>Clandre </I>denied surrender and offered them the opportunity to join the Federation. The Zaranite ship responded by firing its lasers on the <I>Clandre, </I>which raised its shields and held fire. For nearly three hours, the Zaranite vessel pounded the Federation ship, but Captain Harvardson did not return fire, despite some damage to his ship’s engines. Finally, the Zaranites ceased their bombardment and contacted the <I>Clandre, </I>offering to discuss opening diplomatic channels with the Federation. Zaran was eventually admitted to the Federation in Stardate 1/9307 .01,just before the Four Years War began.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With the outbreak of the Four Years War, Zaranite industry geared up to produce military hardware. The Zaranites became skilled manufacturers of laser arms, and soon reached the technological level of advanced Federation worlds.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00ffff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PLACE IN THE FEDERATION</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Membership in the United Federation of Planets has caused a great deal of growth for the Zaranites, financially as well as culturally. In Stardate 2/1001, the first Zaranite graduated from Star Fleet Academy, and presently, there are several dozen Zaranite officers in the Star Fleet. Without exception, they are involved in weapons technology or engineering, and prefer combat or potential combat roles.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Politically, the Zaranites have been a major driving force behind several legislative programs, especially in the area of cultural exchange. They have proven themselves to be shrewd politicians. Their protective suits conceal their expressions, making them dangerous debaters in the political arena.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The weapons business on Zaran has had some difficult times but is improving. The invention of the phaser and photon weapons systems almost bankrupted the laser industries of Zaran. However, the Federation Council voted to loan the planet massive funds to upgrade its weapons facilities to produce shipboard phasers. This loan has caused a great deal of controversy in industrial circles, where manufacturers resent the interference of the Council and believe such ‘favoritism’ will be the death of free enterprise.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Federation politicians believe that the Zaranites are growing too fast and becoming too powerful. Some see a connection between the fact that a Zaranite heads the Department of Finance and that many large contracts seem to end up assigned to Zaran or Zaranite-owned companies. Of course, this distrust is probably no more than jealousy of the Zaranites’ massive industrial base.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The goals of this race seem to be tied in with the <I>Casaval </I>and are difficult to unravel. Though the Zaranites are very curious about the universe around them, they do not wish to share their beliefs with any race or creature. Politically, they are tough opponents and powerful allies.</P></FONT></BODY>
