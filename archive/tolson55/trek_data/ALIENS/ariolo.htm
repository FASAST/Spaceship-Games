<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PLANETARY DESCRIPTION</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fillandia is a large, extremely humid world dominated by tropical forests and extensive mountain ranges. Many find the planet’s heat unbearable—planetary temperature is usually about 35° C. and has been known to reach 50° C. The dense cloud cover produces frequent electrical storms but little rain. Considered by planetologists to be one big continent with scattered seas and lakes, Filiandia is an extremely unstable world. High Richter-scale earthquakes occasionally ravage the planet, and the many volcanoes are frequently active. As if this were not enough, scientists have predicted that Fillandia’s sun will explode in about a hundred years. Some bookies are actually taking bets on whether Fillandia or its star will self-destruct first.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fillandia is one of those rare planets that does not rotate. One side always faces the sun, and the other remains in perpetual darkness. Furthermore, the planet has no axial tilt, and so the inhabitants do not experience any seasonal changes either. The planet circles its star once every 289.4 standard days.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00ffff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RACIAL DESCRIPTION</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ariolo are a race of sentient mammals resembling the centaurs of Terran mythology. They have six appendages: two arms, each with five fingers and an opposable thumb, and four cloven-hoofed legs. The fine hair covering them from head to foot varies from mottled-gray to brown to black. Ariolo have no nasal opening; instead, they have highly developed taste buds on their tongues. Whenever they wish to determine weather patterns, smell flowers, or detect the presence of others, they merely stick out their tongues and taste the air. This sense is so acute that an Ariolon can differentiate between others by smell at one kilometer.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ariolo have a rather slow metabolism. This is fortunate, because if it were any quicker, they would have to spend almost their entire lives eating to support their massive bulk (though many Ariolon would not mind this). Ariolon activity reflects this sluggish metabolism, and off worlders are quick to assume that the Ariolo are lazy and apathetic. However, though slow to react, they are dedicated workers and fierce fighters. When necessary, Ariolo can gallop at 60 kilometers per hour. The Ariolon’s slow metabolism also gives him a life span of 150 standard years.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ariolo eat a lot—they have to. Most of them weigh about 1,000 kilograms, and carrying around all that weight requires a great deal of energy. Since the establishment of the Ifelsi dynasty, the Ariolo have been vegetarians. The humid, tropical environment of Fillandia has given birth to over 10,000 different kinds of edible plants—herbs, fruits, vegetables, leaves, and so forth. Ariolo spend just as much time cooking as they do eating. As one might expect from their hyper-sensitive taste buds, they have very discriminating palates, and are very fussy about their food.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ariolon society is hedonistic. They love to throw and attend <I>aferio, </I>or parties, reminiscent of Alpha Centauran <I>Kirva dentinor </I>or Terran <I>Roman orgies. </I>Pleasure is the central goal of individual Ariolo, and perhaps that is why they have not progressed very far culturally. The <I>aferio </I>allow Ariolo opportunities to sample the finest cuisine and listen to native music. With their six-digit hands, Ariolo are reputed to be the best musicians in the galaxy.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, the Ariolo do not spend all their time at parties. They are diligent workers, and because of their strength and their planet’s low gravity, they have built</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">monumental structures. Unfortunately, Fillandia’s frequent earthquakes have toppled most of the ancient buildings, but the ruins tell tales of gigantic, <I>intricately </I>carved temples and houses.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fillandia is governed by the Farsighted One, a member of the Ifelsi family. The present ruler is a direct descendent of Yfrallo, the leader of the forces that overthrew the previous dynasty. The Farsighted One’s word is law—anyone who forgets that will quickly find himself banished to the dark side of the planet. Just as an individual Ariolon pursues pleasure to attain self-fulfillment, the Farsighted One commands all Ariolo to fulfill the destiny of their race. Theoretically, this ruler is supposed to abstain from seeking pleasure himself so that he can spend all his time furthering Ariolon development. In practice, however this is rarely true.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of all the races the Federation has contacted, the Ariolo are the only one that had not developed the concept of time. They have no natural method to measure time—no nights, no seasonal changes, <I>and no </I>satellites. Each individual decides when he will work, play, or sleep, based on the dictates of self-fulfillment. Ariolo consider death to be an end, but also believe that the individual will be continually reincarnated until he has achieved his highest state. ‘The future’ is a difficult concept for an Ariolon to grasp. If such a phrase could be applied to them, Ariolo would say they live one day at a time.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00ffff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RACIAL HISTORY</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fillandia is a brutal world, where life evolved only with difficulty. When it did develop, however, the various species grew quickly as each tried to become dominant over the others. Eventually, the Ariolo won, and the other animal races soon died out.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Written records relate tales of gigantic monsters thundering across the planet and smiting the ground to bring forth the planet’s blood. Early Ariolo cowered in the jungles for fear of the demons. Then they hit upon the idea of throwing some of their members into volcanoes as human sacrifice. According to Ariolon records, this seemed to stem the planet’s flow of blood.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some time later, an individual named Iroloro began preaching. His views on the seeking of pleasure to reach <I>the </I>highest stage <I>of being stirred the </I>Ariolo, <I>and the race </I>began to build cities and to discover their world and its scientific laws. However, many Ariolo disagreed with Iroloro’s teachings, and took up arms against him. Olirofle, Iroloro’s war chieftain, led his fanatical army against the unbelievers, and after many campaigns, beat them into submission. At this time, Iroloro ruled the entire planet.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When Iroloro died, disagreement broke out as to who would lead the Ariolo. Some (known as Ifelsli) believed that Iroloro’s son lflero should assume the kingship, while others (who were called the Olirri) supported the claim of Olirofle. The two factions fought for supremacy, but eventually, the Olirri won. Before the final battle, Iroloro’s son Iflera entered the dark side of the planet and never returned. Ariolo mythology claimed that the dark side was the home of demons and the abode of the dead. Though none had ever returned from that dread place, Iflera proclaimed that one day he <I>would come back.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Government under the Olirri was rather oppressive, but during their rule, technology increased many fold. Roads, medicine, public housing, sanitation, and the culinary arts were developed. However, civil liberties were often violated, and the persecution of the Ifelsi continued. Needless to say, the Dynasty paid only lip service to the teachings of Iroloro.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then, the Elarioh Saliwah, or the Great Dark Cataclysm of the Gods, occurred. Unusually intense earthquakes shattered some cities, and volcanoes poured fiery lava on others. Civilization was on the verge of ruin when the Ifelsi seized control of the cities. They reintroduced Iroloro’s philosophy, which calmed the populace and strengthened them during this difficult time. Eventually, the cataclysms subsided, and the Ifelsi restored order and rebuilt their civilization. During their reign, the Ariolo invented high-stress alloys and plastics, capable <I>of withstanding the </I>planet’s tremors.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#00ffff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PLACE IN THE FEDERATION</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#ffff00"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Federation discovered the Ariolo in Stardate 1/7912. Since then, UFP engineers have taught them how to relieve their planet’s internal stress and provided them with warp technology, which the Ariolo use to travel the stars seeking new pleasures.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ariolo do not serve in Star Fleet military branches. Ships are too cramped for them, and the thought of automated food sickens them. Although they do work in administrative branches, most Ariolo serve the Federation as civil and chemical engineers, and, of course, as cooks.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Upon learning of the impending destruction of their sun, the Ariolo have discovered the meaning of the word "hurry". They are currently petitioning the Federation Council to award them a new home planet.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ariolo’s greatest gift to the Federation has been its music and musicians. It is worth enduring Fillandia’s harsh climate to listen to a concert by the Fillandian Symphony Orchestra, especially as the concerts are more like festivals, with Ariolon and Federation delicacies served throughout the entire month-long extravaganza.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ariolo have also introduced a new form of music, the Warp Blues, which is currently sweeping the Federation. Sociologists call the meteoric success of this music "The Ariolon Invasion". Among the more popular groups are the Ahmels; and Orellia and the Urflo Hipsters.</P></FONT></BODY>
