In addition to the Constellation, I’ve also included a simple kitbash design I’m calling the Wasp class. It modifies some of the lower saucer details and replaces the lower nacelles with a refit Constitution class secondary hull. Aside from just providing a kitbashing example, I include primarily to give some perspective on how much bigger the Constellation is compared to the Constitution class.
