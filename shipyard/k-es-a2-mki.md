This ship is small and weird looking in the original artwork, and my take on it is perhaps the most radical of interpretations from this kit. Taking a small feature of the side profile artwork, I extended this to a kite-like structure connecting the neck and secondary hull, presumably packed with sensor arrays.

Included are three versions: a Mk I with the original TOS detailing and non-standard command module as seen in the article, a Mk II with a more standard TOS era command module, and a Mk III featuring K’t’inga style details, all with corresponding parts files.
