The [Constellation class studio model](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Constellation_class_model) started out as a small kitbash model intended for display in Captain Picard’s ready room. This model used many parts from standard AMT/Ertl refit Enterprise kits, but also used several anime model kits for smaller details. Most notable of the anime parts are the wings of a Macross VF-1 Valkyrie which can be seen embedded in the top rear of the extended saucer. 
A larger version was later made as a filming model, essentially carrying over most details from the desktop model. This model was first seen as the USS Stargazer in the season one episode “The Battle” and was used sporadically throughout TNG’s run as other Constellation class starships.

In this 3d version, I tried to stay as close to the filming model as I could given my skill level and the availability of detailed photos online. A keen eye will likely note discrepancies, especially with many of the smaller details coming from those anime kits that are hard to make out from photos. However, I think this is an acceptable level of detail for smaller models.
