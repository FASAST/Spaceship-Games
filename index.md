# Welcome to Morena Shipyards

***Role Playing at the Final Frontier...***
 
This group is dedicated to supporting the FASA Star Trek Universe.

The FASA Star Trek Universe is a very different place to the contemporary *canon* Star Trek Universe. When the *RPG* was published, the only source material available was a couple of movies, the animated series and the classic original series. As such FASA drew on what material they could, extrapolated a lot from the limited information available, and made up everything else - the result was a unique version of the Star Trek universe which was an amazingly coherent and immensely fun in which to roleplay or fight ship combat.

If I knew enough about Phase II, I'd have included that as it is more TOS than TMP. Supplements include Character Sheets, GM Screens at present and theoretically more to come as I go through and ""de-Wheeler"" the system. NO efforts towards Starship combat other than what is in 1st edition supplemented by Stardate articles, tables, etc. Loads of new material and alternate House Rules.
