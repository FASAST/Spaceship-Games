# Welcome to Morena Shipyards

***Role Playing at the Final Frontier...***
 
This group is dedicated to supporting the **FASA** Star Trek Universe.

The **FASA** Star Trek® Universe is a very different place to the contemporary *canon* Star Trek Universe. When the *RPG* was published, the only source material available was a couple of movies, the animated series and the classic original series. As such **FASA** drew on what material they could, extrapolated a lot from the limited information available, and made up everything else - the result was a unique version of the Star Trek® universe which was an amazingly coherent and immensely fun in which to roleplay or fight ship combat.

Supplements include Character Sheets, GM Screens at present and theoretically more to come as I go through and ""de-Wheeler"" the system. NO efforts towards Starship combat other than what is in 1st edition supplemented by Stardate articles, tables, etc. Loads of new material and alternate House Rules. { .active }
