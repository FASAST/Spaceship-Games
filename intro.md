# Welcome to Morena Shipyards

***Role Playing at the Final Frontier...***
 
This group is dedicated to supporting the **FASA** Star Trek Universe.

The **FASA** Star Trek® Universe is a very different place to the contemporary *canon* Star Trek Universe. When the *RPG* was published, the only source material available was a couple of movies, the animated series and the classic original series. As such **FASA** drew on what material they could, extrapolated a lot from the limited information available, and made up everything else - the result was a unique version of the Star Trek® universe which was an amazingly coherent and immensely fun in which to roleplay or fight ship combat.
