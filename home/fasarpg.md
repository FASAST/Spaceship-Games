- [Jack Photon's STTRPG 3rd Edition Framework House Rules](http://www.jackphoton.space/) a tear-down, rebuild and mind-melding of 1st and 2nd edition STTRPG skewed 1st edition and focused on TOS/TAS. If I knew enough about Phase II, I'd have included that as it is more TOS than TMP. Supplements include Character Sheets, GM Screens at present and theoretically more to come as I go through and ""de-Wheeler"" the system. NO efforts towards Starship combat other than what is in 1st edition supplemented by Stardate articles, tables, etc. Loads of new material and alternate House Rules. { .active }
